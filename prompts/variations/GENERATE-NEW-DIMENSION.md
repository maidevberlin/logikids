# Generate New Variation Dimension

Use this prompt to brainstorm and create entirely NEW variation dimensions for task randomization.

## Context

We're building randomization for educational task generation (ages 8-16) to prevent repetitive content and increase student engagement. We vary tasks using different dimensions to keep content fresh and engaging.

## Existing Dimensions

- **Scenarios:** Contexts/settings like "birthday party", "space station", "soccer tournament"
- **Problem Framings:** Presentation formats (letter, news article, recipe, scoreboard, diary entry, etc.)
- **Character Dynamics:** Social configurations (solo, collaboration, competition, helping, teaching, etc.)
- **Temporal Contexts:** Time perspectives (past, present, future, conditional, historical, etc.)
- **Metacognitive Prompts:** Thinking prompts (explain reasoning, what-if, check work, etc.)
- **Mystery Framings:** Reverse engineering (answer given, work backwards, deduce missing info, etc.)
- **Real-World Connections:** Daily life applications (shopping, cooking, sports, engineering, etc.)
- **Emotional Framings:** Motivational angles (achievement, curiosity, helpfulness, discovery, etc.)
- **Problem Structure:** Approaches (multi-step, comparison, estimation, patterns, visualization, etc.)

## Your Task

Suggest 3-5 NEW variation dimensions that:

1. Add meaningful variety to task presentation
2. Don't overlap with existing dimensions
3. Work across all subjects (math, logic, language, science, music)
4. Are age-appropriate for 8-16 year olds
5. Can be expressed as simple string templates/instructions for an LLM

## Output Format

For each new dimension, provide:

1. **Dimension Name:** Clear, descriptive name
2. **Description:** What aspect of the task does it vary?
3. **Example Values:** 5-10 concrete examples
4. **Impact:** Why would this increase engagement or variety?
5. **Usage:** How often should it be applied? (Always / 30-50% / Rarely)

## Example Output Format

**Dimension Name:** Cultural Perspectives

**Description:** Frames problems from different cultural or geographical viewpoints to increase diversity and global awareness.

**Example Values:**
- "Set this problem in a Japanese context with local customs"
- "Frame this from a Brazilian carnival perspective"
- "Use examples from Norwegian outdoor traditions"

**Impact:** Exposes students to diverse cultures and makes content more globally relevant. Prevents Western-centric bias.

**Usage:** 20-30% of tasks (occasional cultural enrichment)

Now generate 3-5 new dimensions following this format.
