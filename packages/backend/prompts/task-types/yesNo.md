Create a yes/no task with a question that has a clear boolean answer.

**IMPORTANT**: Generate a balanced mix of questions where the answer is "yes" (true) and questions where the answer is "no" (false). Vary your answers to avoid bias.

## Quality Guidelines

**Question:**
- Must have exactly one unambiguous correct answer (yes or no)
- Include all necessary information for solving
- Create questions where BOTH yes and no are equally likely to be correct

**Explanation:**
- Provide detailed reasoning for the correct answer
- Include key reasoning points
- Reference specific details from the question
- Make it educational and clear
- Explain why the answer is yes OR why it is no
