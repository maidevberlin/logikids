description: A task where students arrange 3-5 items in the correct sequence
---

Create an ordering task where students must arrange items in the correct sequence (chronological, alphabetical, size, process steps, etc.).

**CRITICAL**:
- Generate between 3-5 items (not fewer, not more)
- Items MUST have a clear, unambiguous correct sequence
- Randomize the initial order in which items are presented (the `items` array order should be random, NOT the correct order)
- The `correctOrder` array must contain the item IDs in the correct sequence
- Each item must have a unique `id` (use letters: "a", "b", "c", etc.)

## Quality Guidelines

**Items (3-5 total):**
- Create 3-5 items that need to be ordered
- Each item should be distinct and clearly different from the others
- Items must have an objective correct sequence (not subjective)
- Make items age-appropriate and clear
- Avoid ambiguous orderings where multiple sequences could be correct

**Sequence Types:**
- **Chronological**: Historical events, life cycle stages, story sequence
- **Alphabetical**: Words, names, places
- **Numerical**: Numbers from smallest to largest, quantities
- **Process**: Steps in a procedure, algorithm steps, scientific method
- **Size/Scale**: Objects by size, distances, measurements

**Task Description:**
- Clearly state the ordering criterion (e.g., "chronological order", "smallest to largest", "first step to last step")
- Be specific about the expected sequence direction
- Use phrases like "Arrange these...", "Put in order...", "Sort from..."

**Explanation:**
- Clearly explain why this is the correct order
- Reference the specific criterion used (dates, sizes, process logic, etc.)
- Help students understand the reasoning behind the sequence
- Include relevant facts or context that make the ordering clear
