# Ballad

Create {{count}} varied tasks about **ballads as narrative poems** for a {{age}}-year-old student. Focus on {{focus_area}}.

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Plot Structure Analysis
Students identify and analyze the narrative structure of a ballad.

**Example:**
"Read this excerpt from *'Der Erlkönig'* by Goethe:
*'Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?
Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind;
Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm,
Er fasst ihn sicher, er hält ihn warm.'*

**Analyze the plot:**
1. **Exposition:** What do we learn about the characters and situation?
2. **Setting:** When and where does the story take place?
3. **Conflict:** What problem or danger is introduced?
4. **Atmosphere:** What mood is created? Which words create it?

*Continue reading the ballad and identify the climax and resolution.*"

### Variation 2: Dramatic Elements
Students identify and explain dramatic techniques in ballads.

**Example:**
"Ballads use dramatic elements to build tension. Find these elements in *'John Maynard'*:

**Direct Speech:** Find examples where characters speak directly.
**Example:** _'Wer ist John Maynard?' - 'John Maynard war unser Steuermann...'_

**Repetition:** Which phrases are repeated? What effect does this create?

**Climax:** At which moment is the tension highest?

**Time pressure:** How does the ballad create a sense of urgency?"

### Variation 3: Character Analysis
Students analyze characters in ballads through their actions and speech.

**Example:**
"Analyze the characters in *'Der Zauberlehrling'* (The Sorcerer's Apprentice):

**The Apprentice:**
- What does he do when the master leaves?
- What character traits does this reveal? (brave? foolish? curious?)
- How does he change during the ballad?

**The Broom:**
- How is the broom personified?
- What makes it frightening?

**The Master:**
- What role does he play in the plot?
- What does he represent?"

### Variation 4: Rhythm and Rhyme Analysis
Students examine the poetic form of ballads.

**Example:**
"Analyze the structure of this ballad stanza:
*'Es war ein König in Thule (A)
Gar treu bis an das Grab, (B)
Dem sterbend seine Buhle (A)
Einen goldnen Becher gab.' (B)*

**Tasks:**
1. Mark the rhyme scheme (ABAB, AABB, etc.)
2. Count the syllables per line
3. Which words are stressed? Clap the rhythm
4. How does the regular rhythm support the story?
5. Rewrite one stanza in prose - what is lost?"

### Variation 5: Comparing Ballads
Students compare two different ballads to identify common features.

**Example:**
"Compare *'Der Erlkönig'* (supernatural horror) and *'John Maynard'* (heroic sacrifice):

| Element | Der Erlkönig | John Maynard |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Main conflict** | ? | ? |
| **Type of drama** | ? | ? |
| **Ending** | ? | ? |
| **Tone/Mood** | ? | ? |
| **Use of dialogue** | ? | ? |

**Reflection:** What makes both of these ballads? What do they have in common?"

### Variation 6: Performance Preparation
Students prepare a ballad for dramatic recitation.

**Example:**
"Prepare the first stanza of *'Der Erlkönig'* for performance:
*'Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?
Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind;
Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm,
Er fasst ihn sicher, er hält ihn warm.'*

**Mark your script:**
1. Where will you speak **louder** or **softer**? (Why?)
2. Where will you speak **faster** or **slower**?
3. Which words need special **emphasis**?
4. Where should you **pause** for effect?
5. What **tone of voice** fits each line? (worried? calm? frightening?)

*Practice and record yourself. Does it sound dramatic?*"

### Variation 7: Modern Ballad Connection
Students connect traditional ballads to modern storytelling forms.

**Example:**
"Ballads tell dramatic stories in verse, just like modern rap or storytelling songs.

**Task:** Choose a famous German ballad and plan how to transform it:
1. **As a rap song:** What would the hook/chorus be? How would you keep the rhythm?
2. **As a comic strip:** What are the 6 most important scenes?
3. **As a movie trailer:** Which lines would you use? What music?

*Example: 'Der Zauberlehrling' as a rap - chorus could be: 'Die ich rief, die Geister, werd ich nun nicht los!'*"

### Variation 8: Creating a Mini-Ballad
Students create their own short ballad using learned techniques.

**Example:**
"Write a mini-ballad (2-3 stanzas) about a dramatic event:
- A storm at sea
- A race against time
- A brave rescue
- A mysterious encounter

**Requirements:**
✓ Tell a complete story with beginning, climax, ending
✓ Use a regular rhyme scheme (ABAB or AABB)
✓ Include at least one line of dialogue
✓ Create tension or drama
✓ Use descriptive language for atmosphere

*Start like this: 'Es war einmal...' or 'In dunkler Nacht...'*"
