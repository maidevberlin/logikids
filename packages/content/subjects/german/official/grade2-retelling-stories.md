# Retelling Stories

Create a task where {{name}} practices retelling stories appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Picture Sequence Retelling
Provide 4-6 pictures showing a story sequence and have the student retell the story:
- Look at all pictures first
- Tell what happens in each picture
- Use connecting words: *first, then, next, after that, finally*
- Include details about characters and actions
- Give the story a beginning, middle, and end

## Variation 2: Story Chain with Key Words
Give the student a familiar story (fairy tale, fable, or personal experience) and key words to include:
- List 5-7 important words from the story
- Retell the story making sure to use all key words
- Keep events in the correct order
- Use own words, not memorized phrases
- Speak clearly and at a good pace

## Variation 3: Three-Part Story Structure
Guide the student to retell a story in three clear parts:

**Beginning:**
- Who is in the story?
- Where does it happen?
- When does it happen?

**Middle:**
- What problem happens?
- What do the characters do?

**End:**
- How is the problem solved?
- How does the story end?

## Variation 4: Partner Retelling
Have the student retell a story they heard or read to a partner:
- Listen carefully to the original story
- Remember the most important parts
- Retell without looking at the book
- Partner checks: Did they include all important parts?
- Partner asks questions about missing details

## Variation 5: Time-Order Retelling
Practice retelling a personal experience (school day, trip, party) using time markers:
- *In the morning...*
- *Before lunch...*
- *Afterwards...*
- *In the afternoon...*
- *At the end...*
- *Finally...*

## Variation 6: Retelling with Dialogue
Retell a story including what characters said:
- Describe what happened
- Add character voices: "Then the wolf said..."
- Use quotation gestures or voice changes
- Make the story come alive through dialogue
- Include character emotions

## Variation 7: Story Ladder Retelling
Create a "ladder" of events and retell step by step:
1. How did the story start?
2. What happened first?
3. What happened next?
4. What was the problem?
5. How was it solved?
6. How did it end?

Climb the ladder one step at a time, retelling each part.

## Variation 8: Memory Retelling Game
Listen to a short story (2-3 minutes) and immediately retell it:
- No pictures or text to help
- Remember as many details as possible
- Keep events in order
- Include character names and places
- Use descriptive words from the original story

Focus on:
- *Who* was in the story
- *Where* it happened
- *What* the main events were
- *How* it ended
