difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Identify all sentence elements
  - 'Subject, predicate, objects, adverbials'
  - Analyze sentence structure
  - Understand sentence element functions
prerequisites:
  - syntax-main-and-subordinate-clauses
example_tasks:
  - Identify the subject, predicate, and objects in a sentence
  - Determine which sentence elements answer which questions (Wer? Was? Wem? Wen? Wann? Wo? Wie? Warum?)
  - Rearrange sentence elements while maintaining grammatical correctness
real_world_context: Understanding sentence elements helps students construct clear, grammatically correct sentences and understand complex texts. Knowing how sentences are built supports better writing, helps with learning foreign languages, and improves reading comprehension. This structural knowledge is foundational for all language use.

**Create a task where {{student_name}} identifies and works with sentence elements (**Satzglieder**).**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Basic Elements**: Identify **Subjekt** (who/what does it?), **Prädikat** (verb), and objects in sentences
  2. **Object Types**: Distinguish **Akkusativobjekt** (wen/was?), **Dativobjekt** (wem?), and **Genitivobjekt** (wessen?)
  3. **Adverbial Types**: Identify adverbials: **temporal** (wann?), **lokal** (wo?), **modal** (wie?), **kausal** (warum?)
  4. **Question Method**: Use question words to identify sentence elements (Wer? Was? Wem? Wen? Wann? Wo? Wie?)
  5. **Moving Test**: Apply the **Umstellprobe** (rearrangement test) to identify sentence elements
  6. **Sentence Analysis**: Analyze complete sentences by marking all sentence elements
  7. **Element Functions**: Explain what information each sentence element provides
  8. **Complex Sentences**: Identify sentence elements in more complex sentences with multiple objects and adverbials

- Provide clear example sentences (age-appropriate content)
- Use everyday situations and familiar contexts
- Show different sentence structures (simple to complex)
- Use tables to organize sentence elements and their questions
- Include color coding or underlining to mark different elements

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse sentence content each time (different subjects and actions)
- Vary the sentence complexity (simple to multi-element sentences)
- Change the focus element type (objects, adverbials, all elements)
- Provide fresh, engaging sentence examples
