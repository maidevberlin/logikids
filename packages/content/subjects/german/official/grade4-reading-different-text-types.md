grade: 4
ages:
  - 9
  - 10
focus: Reading and Writing
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Adapt reading technique to text type
  - Read scanning for information
  - Read intensively for understanding
  - 'Navigate in texts (table of contents, index)'
prerequisites:
  - grade-3-reading-strategies
example_tasks:
  - Use the table of contents to find which chapter discusses dinosaurs in a nonfiction book
  - Scan a newspaper article to find the answer to "When did the event happen?" without reading the entire text
  - Compare how you would read a recipe versus how you would read a story - what's different?
real_world_context: Different texts require different reading strategies. We scan train schedules for departure times, skim news headlines for interesting stories, and read instruction manuals carefully step-by-step.

# Reading Different Text Types

Create tasks about adapting reading strategies to different text types for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Text Type Recognition

Help students identify different kinds of texts:

**Common text types**:

| Type | Purpose | Features |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Story/Narrative** | Entertain, tell events | Characters, plot, dialogue |
| **Informational** | Teach, explain | Facts, headings, diagrams |
| **Instructions** | Guide how to do something | Steps, numbered lists, commands |
| **Persuasive** | Convince reader | Opinions, reasons, emotional language |
| **Descriptive** | Paint a picture | Sensory details, adjectives |

Create recognition tasks:
- "Read this excerpt: {{text_sample}}. What type of text is this? How do you know?"
- "Match the text purpose to the type: {{purpose}} → {{text_type_options}}"
- "Which features tell you this is a {{text_type}}: {{feature_list}}"

## Scanning for Specific Information

Teach quick information location:

**Scanning** = Looking for specific facts without reading everything

**When to scan**:
- Finding a phone number in directory
- Looking up a word in dictionary
- Finding a date in an article
- Locating a name in a list

**Scanning strategies**:
1. Know what you're looking for
2. Look for key words or numbers
3. Use alphabetical or numerical order
4. Read only the parts that might have the info
5. Skip irrelevant sections

Create scanning tasks:
- "Scan this text to find: {{specific_info}}. Which paragraph contains it?"
- "You need to know {{question}}. Where would you look in this {{text_type}}?"
- "Find three {{items}} in this {{text}}. Time yourself - how fast can you find them?"

## Skimming for Main Ideas

Develop overview reading skills:

**Skimming** = Quick reading to get general idea

**When to skim**:
- Deciding if article is interesting
- Getting overview before detailed reading
- Reviewing material you've read before
- Comparing multiple sources quickly

**What to read when skimming**:
- Title and headings
- First and last paragraphs
- First sentence of each paragraph
- Bold or highlighted words
- Pictures and captions

| Reading Type | Speed | Detail | Purpose |
|--------------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Skimming** | Fast | Low | Get main idea |
| **Scanning** | Fast | Specific | Find one fact |
| **Intensive** | Slow | High | Understand fully |

Create skimming tasks:
- "Skim this article about {{topic}}. What is the main idea? You have {{time}} seconds."
- "Read only the headings in this chapter. What will you learn about?"
- "Which article is more relevant to {{topic}}: Article A or Article B? Skim both to decide."

## Intensive Reading for Understanding

Guide careful, thorough reading:

**Intensive reading** = Slow, careful reading to understand fully

**When to read intensively**:
- Following instructions
- Studying for a test
- Reading complex information
- Analyzing literature

**Intensive reading strategies**:
- Read every word carefully
- Reread difficult parts
- Take notes
- Look up unknown words
- Think about what you read
- Ask yourself questions

Create intensive reading tasks:
- "Read these instructions for {{task}}. What are the {{number}} steps?"
- "This paragraph about {{complex_topic}} is difficult. What strategy would help you understand it?"
- "After reading {{text}}, explain {{concept}} in your own words."

## Using Text Features

Teach navigation using organizational elements:

**Text features in nonfiction**:

| Feature | Purpose | How to Use |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Table of contents** | Shows chapter topics | Find which chapter has your topic |
| **Index** | Alphabetical topic list | Find specific subjects quickly |
| **Headings** | Mark new sections | See how text is organized |
| **Bold words** | Important vocabulary | Identify key terms |
| **Captions** | Explain images | Understand pictures and diagrams |
| **Glossary** | Define terms | Look up word meanings |

Create navigation tasks:
- "Use the table of contents: {{toc}}. Which chapter would help you learn about {{topic}}?"
- "This book has no page number for {{topic}} in the index. What should you try next?"
- "Count the headings in this chapter. How many main topics are covered?"

## Adjusting Reading Speed

Recognize when to speed up or slow down:

**Read quickly when**:
- Text is familiar
- Material is easy
- You need general information
- You're reviewing

**Read slowly when**:
- Topic is new or difficult
- Details are important
- You'll be tested
- Following directions

Create speed adjustment tasks:
- "You're reading a {{text_type}} about {{topic}}. Should you read quickly or slowly? Why?"
- "Which part of this article needs careful reading: {{part_a}} or {{part_b}}?"
- "You have {{time}} to learn about {{topic}}. Plan your reading strategy."

## Reading Different Genres

Adapt approach based on genre:

**Fiction reading approach**:
- Focus on characters and plot
- Enjoy the story flow
- Notice dialogue and description
- Think about theme

**Nonfiction reading approach**:
- Note main ideas and supporting details
- Use text features to navigate
- Check understanding of facts
- Make connections to prior knowledge

**Poetry reading approach**:
- Read multiple times
- Notice sound and rhythm
- Visualize imagery
- Think about meaning

Create genre-specific tasks:
- "You're reading a {{genre}} text. What should you pay most attention to?"
- "Compare reading this story vs. this informational text about the same {{topic}}. What's different?"
- "List three questions to ask yourself while reading a {{genre}} text."

## Purpose-Driven Reading

Match technique to reading goal:

**Reading purposes**:
- *For pleasure*: Relax, enjoy the story
- *For information*: Learn specific facts
- *For instructions*: Complete a task
- *For study*: Remember and understand
- *For evaluation*: Form opinion about quality

Create purpose-based tasks:
- "Your purpose is to {{goal}}. Which reading technique is best: scanning, skimming, or intensive reading?"
- "You're reading {{text}} for {{purpose}}. What should you focus on?"
- "Before reading this {{text_type}}, decide: why am I reading this? How will that affect how I read?"

## Comprehension Monitoring

Teach self-checking while reading:

**Good readers**:
- Notice when they don't understand
- Reread confusing parts
- Ask questions
- Make predictions
- Connect to what they know
- Visualize what they read

**Fix-up strategies when confused**:
- Reread the sentence or paragraph
- Read more slowly
- Look at pictures or diagrams
- Look up unknown words
- Ask someone for help
- Read ahead for context

Create monitoring tasks:
- "This sentence is confusing: {{complex_sentence}}. What strategy would help you understand it?"
- "After reading {{paragraph}}, ask yourself: Do I understand this? What should you do if the answer is no?"
- "You don't understand {{word}} in this context. List two strategies to figure out its meaning."

**Task variation**: Use authentic text types students encounter (recipes, instruction manuals, textbooks, websites, menus, schedules). Include metacognitive elements where students reflect on their reading process.
