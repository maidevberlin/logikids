**Create a task where {{student_name}} practices critical reading and text evaluation.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Author's Purpose**: Identify why the text was written (to inform, persuade, entertain, sell) and for whom
  2. **Bias Detection**: Recognize one-sided presentation, loaded language, or missing perspectives
  3. **Argument Evaluation**: Assess whether claims are supported by evidence or are just opinions
  4. **Source Credibility**: Evaluate reliability based on author expertise, publication, citations, and objectivity
  5. **Persuasive Techniques**: Identify rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, or manipulation tactics
  6. **Fact-Checking**: Question claims and consider what information might be missing
  7. **Multiple Perspectives**: Compare how different sources present the same topic
  8. **Media Literacy**: Recognize differences between news, advertising, opinion pieces, and propaganda

- Provide text examples (200-300 words) from different sources
- Use age-appropriate topics (advertising, news articles, opinion pieces, informational texts)
- Include examples with clear bias, weak arguments, or persuasive techniques
- Encourage questioning and evidence-based evaluation
- Use tables to compare sources or evaluate arguments

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse text types each time (news, ads, opinions, informational)

- Change the specific topics and sources
- Provide fresh, engaging texts for critical analysis
