version_notes: Initial concept for Grade 11 advanced literary interpretation
---

Advanced literary interpretation at grade 11 requires students to move beyond analysis of individual textual elements to develop original, sophisticated theses about literary works. Students must engage with the hermeneutic tradition, recognizing that interpretation involves a dialogue between text, reader, and scholarly community.

This concept emphasizes the integration of close reading with appropriate contextualization, the critical engagement with secondary literature, and the defense of interpretive positions through evidence and argument. Students should understand that literary texts support multiple valid interpretations while also recognizing that not all interpretations are equally well-supported by textual evidence.
