example_tasks:
  - Rewrite a scene from a story from a different character's perspective (first person to third person or vice versa)
  - Write the same event twice - once from the perspective of the main character and once from an observer
  - Analyze how changing narrative perspective changes the reader's understanding of a story

Narrative perspective teaches students that the same event can be experienced and described differently depending on who tells the story. This skill develops empathy and critical thinking.

**Create a task where {{student_name}} works with changing narrative perspectives.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **I-Narrator to Third-Person**: Rewrite a text passage from first-person ("Ich") to third-person ("Er/Sie") perspective
  2. **Third-Person to I-Narrator**: Transform a third-person narrative into a first-person account
  3. **Character Perspective Switch**: Rewrite a scene from a different character's point of view
  4. **Multiple Perspectives**: Write the same event from two or three different characters' perspectives
  5. **Perspective Analysis**: Analyze how perspective affects what information the reader receives and how they feel
  6. **Limited vs. Omniscient**: Compare limited perspective (one character's view) with omniscient narrator (all-knowing)
  7. **Perspective Effects**: Discuss how changing perspective changes the story's tone, suspense, or emotional impact
  8. **Creative Writing**: Write an original scene, then rewrite it from a different perspective

- Provide clear examples of both first-person and third-person narration
- Use familiar story situations (conflict between friends, family situations, school events, adventure moments)
- Highlight how pronouns change (ich/er/sie, mein/sein/ihr, etc.)
- Show how perspective affects what the narrator knows and can tell
- Use tables to compare perspectives side by side

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse story situations each time (avoid repetition)
- Vary the perspective transformation (1st to 3rd, 3rd to 1st, character switches)
- Change the emotional tone and context of scenes
- Provide fresh, engaging narrative examples
