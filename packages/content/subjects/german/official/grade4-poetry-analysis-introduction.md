# Poetry Analysis (Introduction)

Create tasks about analyzing and understanding poetry for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Rhyme Schemes

Teach students to identify and label rhyme patterns:

**Common rhyme schemes**:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **AABB** | Couplets - pairs rhyme | Roses are red (A) / Violets are blue (B) / Sugar is sweet (A) / And so are you (B) |
| **ABAB** | Alternating rhyme | The moon shines bright (A) / Upon the sea (B) / It fills the night (A) / With mystery (B) |
| **ABCB** | Second and fourth lines rhyme | I wandered far (A) / Across the land (B) / Under a star (C) / To understand (B) |
| **ABBA** | Enclosed rhyme | The forest deep and dark (A) / Where shadows softly fall (B) / I hear the foxes call (B) / And see the question mark (A) |

Create rhyme scheme tasks:
- "Label this stanza's rhyme scheme: {{four_line_stanza}}"
- "Write two more lines to complete this AABB pattern: {{two_lines}}"
- "This poem has the rhyme scheme {{pattern}}. Find and underline the rhyming words."

## Poetic Devices - Imagery

Explore language that creates mental pictures:

**Sensory imagery**:
- *Visual*: Colors, shapes, movement ("golden sunlight")
- *Auditory*: Sounds ("rustling leaves")
- *Tactile*: Touch, texture ("rough bark")
- *Olfactory*: Smells ("sweet roses")
- *Gustatory*: Taste ("bitter cold")

Create imagery tasks:
- "In the line '{{poetic_line}}', which sense does the poet appeal to? What image does it create?"
- "Find all the visual imagery in this stanza: {{stanza}}"
- "The poet writes '{{image}}'. Draw or describe what you see in your mind."

## Poetic Devices - Personification

Identify when objects or nature are given human qualities:

**Examples**:
- *The wind whispered through the trees*
- *The sun smiled down on us*
- *Time marches on*
- *Winter's icy fingers*

Create personification tasks:
- "Which line contains personification: '{{line_a}}' or '{{line_b}}'? How can you tell?"
- "In '{{personification_example}}', what human quality is given to {{object}}?"
- "Finish this personification: The {{object}} {{verb}}..."

## Poetic Devices - Metaphor and Simile

Compare using figurative language:

**Similes** - Direct comparison using *like* or *as*:
- "Her smile was like sunshine"
- "As brave as a lion"

**Metaphors** - Indirect comparison (says something IS something else):
- "Her smile was sunshine"
- "He is a lion in battle"

| Device | Structure | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Simile** | Uses "like" or "as" | The clouds were like cotton candy |
| **Metaphor** | Direct equation | The clouds were cotton candy |

Create comparison tasks:
- "Is this a simile or metaphor: '{{comparison}}'? How do you know?"
- "The poet compares {{thing_a}} to {{thing_b}}. Why do you think they made this comparison?"
- "Turn this simile into a metaphor: '{{simile}}'"

## The Lyrical I

Understand the speaker/narrator in poetry:

**Lyrical I** = The voice speaking in the poem (not always the poet themselves!)

**Questions to ask**:
- Who is speaking?
- What is their situation?
- What emotions do they express?
- What is their perspective?

Create lyrical I tasks:
- "Who is the lyrical I in this poem: {{excerpt}}? How can you tell?"
- "What emotion does the lyrical I express in these lines: {{emotional_lines}}?"
- "Compare the lyrical I in poem A and poem B. How are they different?"

## Mood and Atmosphere

Identify the feeling created by the poem:

**Common moods**:
- *Joyful/Happy*: Bright words, cheerful images
- *Sad/Melancholy*: Dark colors, slow rhythm
- *Peaceful/Calm*: Gentle words, nature imagery
- *Mysterious*: Shadows, questions, unknown
- *Scary/Tense*: Dark imagery, sharp sounds
- *Excited/Energetic*: Fast rhythm, active verbs

**Mood creators**:
- Word choice (gentle vs. harsh)
- Imagery (bright vs. dark)
- Rhythm (fast vs. slow)
- Sounds (soft vs. loud)

Create mood tasks:
- "What mood does this stanza create: {{stanza}}? Which words create this feeling?"
- "Change three words in this line to make it feel {{different_mood}} instead of {{current_mood}}: {{line}}"
- "The poet uses {{imagery_description}} to create a {{mood}} atmosphere. Find two examples."

## Repetition and Sound

Recognize patterns and musical elements:

**Repetition types**:
- Word repetition (same word repeated for emphasis)
- Line repetition (refrain)
- Sound repetition (alliteration)

**Alliteration** - Same starting sound:
- *Peter Piper picked...*
- *Slippery, slimy snake*

Create sound tasks:
- "Which word is repeated in this stanza and why: {{stanza_with_repetition}}?"
- "Find the alliteration in: '{{line_with_alliteration}}'"
- "The repeated line '{{refrain}}' appears {{number}} times. What effect does this create?"

## Structure and Form

Examine how poems are organized:

**Structural elements**:
- **Stanza**: Group of lines (like a paragraph)
- **Line break**: Where the line ends
- **Verse**: Another word for stanza
- **Couplet**: Two-line stanza

**Stanza types**:
- 2 lines = Couplet
- 3 lines = Tercet
- 4 lines = Quatrain

Create structure tasks:
- "How many stanzas does this poem have? How many lines in each?"
- "Why do you think the poet started a new stanza at line {{number}}?"
- "This poem is written in {{stanza_type}}s. What pattern do you notice?"

## Theme and Message

Identify what the poem is really about:

**Common themes**:
- Nature and seasons
- Friendship and family
- Growing up and change
- Beauty and wonder
- Loss and memory
- Adventure and discovery

Create theme tasks:
- "What is this poem mainly about: {{short_poem}}?"
- "The poet describes {{surface_topic}}, but what deeper message might they be sharing?"
- "Two poems both describe {{topic}}. How do their messages differ?"

## Comparing Poems

Analyze similarities and differences:

**Comparison aspects**:
- Form (structure, rhyme scheme)
- Theme (topic, message)
- Mood (feeling created)
- Devices (imagery, metaphor, etc.)
- Lyrical I (speaker's voice)

Create comparison tasks:
- "Both poems are about {{topic}}. How do they describe it differently?"
- "Poem A uses {{device_a}} while Poem B uses {{device_b}}. Which creates a stronger image?"
- "Compare the mood in these two poems: {{poem_a_excerpt}} vs {{poem_b_excerpt}}"

**Task variation**: Use poems about different themes (nature, family, seasons, animals, feelings). Include both analysis of existing poems and creative tasks where students write their own simple verses.
