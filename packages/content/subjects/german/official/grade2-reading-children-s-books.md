## Variation 1: Character Analysis
After reading a book, have the student create a character profile for the main character:
- **Name** and **age**
- **Appearance** (how they look)
- **Personality** (brave, curious, shy, funny)
- **What they want** (their goal)
- **Problems they face**
- **How they change** during the story

## Variation 2: Story Elements Chart
Guide the student to identify and describe key story elements:

| Element | Description |

| **Setting** | Where and when the story happens |
| **Main Characters** | Who is in the story? |
| **Problem** | What challenge do they face? |
| **Important Events** | What happens? (3-5 events) |
| **Solution** | How is the problem solved? |
| **Ending** | How does the story end? |

## Variation 3: Book Recommendation
Have the student write a recommendation for someone who hasn't read the book:
- What is the book about? (2-3 sentences, no spoilers!)
- Who would enjoy this book? (age, interests)
- What did you like most?
