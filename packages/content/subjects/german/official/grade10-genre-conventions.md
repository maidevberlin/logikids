difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify clear genre markers in familiar genres (fairy tale, detective story)

    - Detect obvious genre subversions (unexpected ending)
  medium:
    - Analyze subtle genre signals in mixed-form texts
    - Explain how multiple genre expectations interact in hybrid works
    - Trace genre evolution across two or three historical periods
  hard:
    - Evaluate strategic genre choices in experimental literature
    - Analyze complex genre subversion that reinforces deeper themes
    - Compare genre systems across different national literatures
real_world_context:
  - A detective novel begins with the detective as the criminal
  - A romantic comedy in which the couple deliberately chooses not to get together
  - A fantasy story set in a realistic modern office workplace
  - A science fiction tale told entirely through diary entries from the 1800s
  - A horror story where the monster turns out to be the hero
  - A bildungsroman where the protagonist actively resists personal growth
  - A tragic play that suddenly shifts to slapstick comedy in the final act
  - A fairy tale retold from the villain's sympathetic perspective
  - A western set in outer space with cowboys piloting spaceships
  - A historical novel that includes magical realism elements
  - A sports story where the team loses but finds something more valuable
  - A dystopian future written as a cheerful tourism brochure
  - A mystery where all the clues point to impossible supernatural explanations

  - An epic adventure where heroes stay home and imagine the quest instead
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid requiring knowledge of obscure or adult-oriented genres
  - Don't use examples where genre is so mixed it becomes unidentifiable
  - Avoid claiming there is only one correct genre classification
  - Don't present genre subversion as inherently better than following conventions
  - Avoid texts requiring extensive historical knowledge beyond grade 10 scope
