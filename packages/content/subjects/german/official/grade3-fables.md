## Task Variations

Choose ONE of these variations:

1. **Identifying the Moral**
   - Present a short fable (6-8 sentences)

   - Explain how the story teaches this lesson
   - Examples: "The Lion and the Mouse", "The Ant and the Grasshopper"

2. **Animal Character Analysis**
   - Provide a fable with typical animal characters
   - Students create a table: **Animal** | **Characteristic** | **Human Behavior**
   - Examples: fox = clever, lion = powerful, lamb = gentle
   - Explain why these animals were chosen

3. **Fable vs. Fairy Tale**
   - Compare features in a table
   - Categories: **Length**, **Characters**, **Magic**, **Lesson**, **Setting**
   - Identify which genre several short texts belong to
   - Explain the main differences

4. **Writing a Simple Fable**
   - Choose a moral (e.g., "Honesty is important", "Don't be greedy")
   - Create animal characters with matching traits
   - Write a short fable (5-7 sentences) teaching this moral
   - Include clear beginning, problem, and lesson

5. **Moral Application**
   - Present a fable and its moral
   - Students think of 3 real-life situations where this moral applies
   - Example: "The Tortoise and the Hare" → slow and steady wins
   - Apply to school, sports, learning

6. **Character Motivation**
   - Read a fable
   - Analyze why characters behave as they do
   - Table: **Character** | **Action** | **Motivation** | **Result**

7. **Fable Elements Checklist**
   - List key elements of fables
   - Elements: animal characters, short length, clear moral, human-like behavior

   - Explain what's missing in non-fables

8. **Modern Fable Creation**
   - Write a fable with modern setting
   - Same structure and moral, different context
   - Example: "The City Mouse and the Country Mouse" → modern city/village
   - Keep the lesson but update the details
