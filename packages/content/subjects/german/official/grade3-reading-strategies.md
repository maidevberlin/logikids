# Reading Strategies

Create a task where {{name}} learns active reading strategies appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Preview Before Reading (Pre-Reading Strategy)
Practice the "Preview" strategy to prepare for reading:

**Before you start reading, look at:**
1. **Title** - What is the text about?
2. **Headings and subheadings** - How is it organized?
3. **Pictures, diagrams, captions** - What do they show?
4. **First and last paragraphs** - Introduction and conclusion
5. **Bold or italic words** - Important terms

**Then predict:**
- What will this text be about?
- What might I learn?
- What do I already know about this topic?

Practice with an informational text and write down your predictions.

## Variation 2: SQ3R Method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)
Learn a structured reading strategy:

**S - Survey:** Scan the text (titles, headings, pictures)
**Q - Question:** Turn headings into questions
**R - Read:** Read to answer your questions
**R - Recite:** Say the answers in your own words
**R - Review:** Look back and summarize what you learned

**Example:**
- Heading: "Animals in Winter"
- Question: "What do animals do in winter?"
- Read to find the answer
- Recite: "Some animals hibernate, others migrate"
- Review: Summarize the whole section

## Variation 3: Marking Important Information
Learn to identify and mark key information:

**What to mark:**
- **Main idea** of each paragraph (underline)
- **Important details** (highlight or star)
- **New vocabulary** (circle)
- **Confusing parts** (question mark in margin)
- **Interesting facts** (exclamation mark)

Practice with a 2-page text. Don't mark everything - only what's truly important!

## Variation 4: Asking Questions While Reading
Develop active reading through questioning:

**Types of questions to ask:**
- **Before reading:** What will this be about?
- **During reading:**
  - Why did that happen?
  - What does this word mean?
  - How does this connect to what I already know?
  - What will happen next?
- **After reading:** What was the main point?

Read a text and write down 5 questions (and answers if you found them).

## Variation 5: Finding Main Ideas
Practice distinguishing main ideas from details:

**Strategy:**
For each paragraph, ask:
- What is this paragraph mostly about? (main idea)
- What details support the main idea?

| Paragraph | Main Idea | Supporting Details |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |

**Tip:** The main idea is often in the first or last sentence of a paragraph.

## Variation 6: Making Connections
Connect text to your own knowledge and experience:

**Three types of connections:**

**Text-to-Self:** Reminds me of when I...
*"This character feels nervous like I felt on my first day of school."*

**Text-to-Text:** This is similar to another book/text...
*"This is like the fairy tale Cinderella because both have mean stepsisters."*

**Text-to-World:** This relates to real world events...
*"This is about climate change, which is happening in real life."*

Read a text and make at least one of each type of connection.

## Variation 7: Summarizing Strategy
Learn to write effective summaries:

**Good summaries:**
- Include only main ideas, not small details
- Use your own words, not copied sentences
- Are much shorter than the original text
- Answer: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?

**Steps:**
1. Read the whole text
2. Identify the main idea of each section
3. Write 1-2 sentences per section
4. Combine into a short paragraph
5. Check: Did I include only important information?

## Variation 8: Fix-Up Strategies When Confused
Learn what to do when you don't understand:

**If you don't understand:**

1. **Reread** the confusing part slowly
2. **Read ahead** - it might become clear
3. **Look at pictures or diagrams** for clues
4. **Break down** long sentences into smaller parts
5. **Look up** unknown words
6. **Ask for help** if still confused
7. **Make a note** of questions to discuss

**Practice:** Find a challenging text. When you get confused, try three different fix-up strategies.

**Remember - Good Readers:**
- Have a purpose for reading
- Preview before they read
- Ask questions while reading
- Make connections
- Mark important parts
- Reread when confused
- Summarize what they learned
