difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Shorter prose excerpts with clear narrative structure and explicit themes
    - Straightforward narrative perspective with consistent point of view
    - Direct symbolic elements and obvious motifs easily traceable through text
  medium:
    - Novel chapters requiring analysis of both excerpt and broader work context
    - Complex narrative techniques (shifting perspectives, temporal manipulation)
    - Layered symbolism requiring interpretation across multiple textual levels
  hard:
    - Experimental or modernist prose with ambiguous narrative structure
    - Integration of multiple analytical frameworks (form, content, epoch, biography)
    - Examination-level tasks requiring complete interpretation in limited time
prerequisites:
  - grade11-literary-interpretation
  - grade10-novel-interpretation
  - grade8-narrative-techniques
real_world_context:
  - Analyzing Kafka's prose to understand alienation in modern bureaucratic society
  - Examining Thomas Mann's narrative technique in exploring German bourgeois culture

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid biographical fallacy (assuming narrator equals author without evidence)

  - Avoid treating all techniques as equally significant regardless of text
  - Don't expect single correct interpretation; accept multiple defensible readings
  - Avoid excerpts requiring extensive plot knowledge from unread full works
