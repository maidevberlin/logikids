**Create a task where {{student_name}} writes extended, comprehensive summaries.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Comprehensive Summary**: Summarize a longer text (400-600 words) into a concise summary (150-200 words)
  2. **Multi-Paragraph Summary**: Summarize different sections or chapters, organizing by topic
  3. **Objective Style**: Practice objective, neutral language without personal opinions or judgments
  4. **Present Tense**: Use **Präsens** (present tense) consistently in summaries
  5. **Indirect Speech**: Convert quotes and dialogue into indirect speech for summaries
  6. **Main Idea Selection**: Identify and include only essential information, omitting details and examples
  7. **Summary Structure**: Use proper structure (introduction with title/author/topic, main content, conclusion if needed)
  8. **Proportion Maintenance**: Ensure summary reflects the original's emphasis and proportion

- Provide source texts (350-500 words) from various types
- Use age-appropriate content (stories, articles, informational texts)
- Show difference between detailed retelling and concise summary
- Emphasize objectivity and neutrality
- Use present tense and indirect speech appropriately

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse source texts each time (narrative, informational, argumentative)
- Vary the summary challenge (length reduction, objectivity, structure)
- Change the specific topics and text types
- Provide fresh, engaging texts to summarize
