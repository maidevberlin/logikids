  - Understand and apply Aristotelian dramatic concepts (mimesis, catharsis, unity of action/time/place)
  - Analyze Lessing's contributions to German dramatic theory (Hamburgische Dramaturgie)
  - Compare Aristotelian drama with Brechtian epic theater (Verfremdungseffekt, narrative structure)
  - Identify and analyze characteristics of absurd drama (Theater of the Absurd)
  - Trace the historical development of dramatic theory from classical to contemporary forms
  - Apply theoretical frameworks to interpret and evaluate dramatic texts
  - Use drama theory terminology precisely in analytical writing
problem_types:
  - Theoretical concept identification
  - Framework application
  - Historical comparison
  - Aristotelian analysis
  - Epic theater analysis
  - Absurdist interpretation
  - Theory-based argumentation
  - Cross-theoretical comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify and define basic theoretical concepts (catharsis, Verfremdungseffekt, absurdity)
    - Recognize which theoretical framework applies to a given dramatic excerpt
    - Match theoretical principles to their historical originators
  medium:
    - Apply theoretical concepts to analyze specific dramatic texts
    - Compare classical and epic theater approaches to similar dramatic situations
    - Explain how absurdist techniques challenge traditional dramatic conventions
  hard:
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of different theoretical frameworks for interpreting complex dramas
    - Synthesize multiple theoretical perspectives in a comprehensive analysis
    - Argue for or against theoretical positions using textual evidence
prerequisites:
  - grade11-classical-drama
  - grade10-drama-interpretation
real_world_context:
  - A theater director decides whether to stage Brecht's Mother Courage using Verfremdungseffekt or more naturalistic techniques
  - Literature students debate whether Aristotle's concept of catharsis applies to modern psychological dramas
  - A dramaturgy seminar examines how Lessing's theories challenged French neoclassical rigidity in 18th-century theater
  - Critics analyze whether a contemporary production successfully achieves the alienation effect Brecht advocated
  - Theater historians trace how the three unities dominated European drama until Romantic rebellion
  - A university class compares how Sophocles and Brecht handle tragic protagonists differently based on their theoretical foundations
  - Aspiring playwrights study absurdist techniques to understand how Beckett and Ionesco broke conventional dramatic rules
  - A theater festival programs plays representing different theoretical traditions to show the evolution of dramatic form
  - Drama students analyze why Waiting for Godot frustrated audiences expecting Aristotelian plot structure
  - Literary scholars debate whether epic theater's political goals compromise its aesthetic value
  - A director's commentary explains choices based on understanding Lessing's preference for character-driven over plot-driven drama
  - Theater critics evaluate a production's success in creating the emotional distance Brecht considered essential
  - Students examine how absurdist drama reflects post-war existential philosophy through deliberate meaninglessness
  - A comparative literature course analyzes how different cultures adapted or rejected Aristotelian dramatic principles
  - Dramatists discuss whether contemporary theater has moved beyond or returned to classical theoretical foundations
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid requiring memorization of dates without theoretical understanding
  - Don't oversimplify complex theories into binary oppositions
  - Avoid texts requiring knowledge of plays students may not have read
  - Don't present theory as prescriptive rules rather than analytical frameworks
  - Avoid terminology without context that clarifies its theoretical significance
