## Task Variations

   - Checklist: **Wer?** (Who?) | **Was?** (What?) | **Wann?** (When?) | **Wo?** (Where?) | **Warum?** (Why?) | **Wie?** (How?)
   - Report should be 5-7 sentences

2. **Story to Report Transformation**
   - Present a narrative story with emotions and opinions

   - Remove subjective language, keep only facts
   - Example: "Es war ein furchtbar aufregender Tag..." → "Am Montag fand..."

3. **Missing Information**
   - Provide an incomplete report
   - Students identify which W-questions are not answered
   - Add the missing information
   - Complete the report

4. **Objective vs. Subjective Language**
   - Present pairs of sentences (objective vs. subjective)
   - Students identify which is suitable for a report
   - Examples: "Das Fest war toll!" vs. "Das Fest fand am Samstag statt."
   - Rewrite subjective sentences objectively

5. **Event Report Template**
   - Provide a structured template with sections
   - Sections: **Headline**, **When and Where**, **What Happened**, **Participants**, **Result**
   - Students fill in based on given event details
   - Example event: Class trip to the zoo

6. **Report from Notes**
   - Provide bullet-point notes about an incident
   - Students write a flowing report
   - Notes: "Dienstag", "Pause", "Ball durchs Fenster", "Klasse 3b", "Glas zerbrochen"
   - Create complete sentences with all information

7. **Headline and Report**
   - Students create an appropriate headline
   - Write a matching report (4-5 sentences)
   - Example topics: school celebration, lost-and-found item, sports event
   - Headline should summarize main point

8. **Interview to Report**
   - Present questions and answers from an interview
   - Students write a report based on the information
   - Transform direct speech into indirect speech
