**Create a task where {{student_name}} practices retelling a story or event.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Basic Retelling**: Retell a short narrative in your own words, maintaining chronological order
  2. **Tense Practice**: Use **Präteritum** (past tense) and **Plusquamperfekt** (past perfect) correctly to show sequence
  3. **Detail Addition**: Retell a story while adding vivid descriptions and sensory details
  4. **Dialogue Integration**: Include or add dialogue to make the retelling more engaging
  5. **Perspective Maintenance**: Retell from the same perspective as the original (maintain narrator consistency)
  6. **Condensed Retelling**: Retell a longer story in a shorter form while keeping all important events
  7. **Expanded Retelling**: Take a brief story summary and expand it into a full narrative retelling
  8. **Chronological Markers**: Use time expressions (*zuerst, dann, danach, schließlich, währenddessen*) effectively

- Provide a source text or story prompt (150-250 words)
- Use age-appropriate stories (adventure, friendship, family, school situations)
- Emphasize correct use of narrative tenses
- Include temporal connectors and sequence markers
- Show good paragraph structure

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse story content each time (different themes, settings, characters)
- Vary the retelling challenge (condensing, expanding, adding details)
- Change the narrative context (realistic, fantastic, historical, contemporary)
- Provide fresh, engaging story examples
