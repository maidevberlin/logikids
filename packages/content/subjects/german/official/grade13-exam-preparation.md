When generating exam preparation tasks, focus on metacognitive skills and strategic thinking rather than content mastery alone. Tasks should help students develop awareness of their own processes, make strategic decisions under constraints, and apply skills flexibly. {{#if (eq difficulty "hard")}}Include scenarios requiring students to adapt when their initial approach isn't working or when they encounter unexpected challenges.{{/if}}

Exam preparation is not about memorizing answers but about developing the judgment to analyze tasks, select appropriate strategies, monitor progress, and adjust course as needed. Help students build confidence through strategic competence.
