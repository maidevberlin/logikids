  - Apply German capitalization rules for nouns, sentence beginnings, and formal address

  - Apply morphological strategies to determine correct spelling through root words and word families
problem_types:
  - Vowel length marking
  - Consonant doubling
  - S-sound selection
  - Capitalization identification
  - Comma placement
  - Direct speech punctuation
  - Error correction
  - Rule application
  - Spelling strategy selection
  - Morphological analysis
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-syllable or two-syllable words with clear sound patterns
    - Obvious capitalization rules (sentence starts, common nouns)
    - Simple comma rules in lists of 3-4 items
  medium:
    - Multi-syllable words requiring vowel length analysis
    - Capitalization of nominalized verbs and adjectives
    - Comma rules between main and subordinate clauses
  hard:
    - Complex word families requiring morphological analysis
    - Ambiguous cases requiring multiple spelling strategies
    - Complex sentence structures with multiple comma placements
prerequisites:
  - grade4-spelling-strategies
real_world_context:
  - Writing formal emails and letters to teachers, officials, or companies requires correct capitalization of Sie
  - Reading published books and magazines demonstrates consistent spelling patterns students can recognize and apply
  - Text messaging and social media writing benefits from knowing when to apply formal spelling rules versus informal communication
  - School assignments and tests are evaluated partly on spelling accuracy and punctuation correctness
  - Understanding spelling patterns helps when learning new vocabulary and recognizing unfamiliar words in context
  - Writing thank-you notes or invitations requires correct punctuation with commas and quotation marks
  - Proofreading school newspaper articles to ensure professional appearance and readability

This concept covers the complete Grade 5 spelling curriculum including vowel length markers (Dehnung), vowel shortness markers (Schärfung), s-sound spelling rules, capitalization rules for all contexts, and punctuation including commas in lists and between clauses, quotation marks for direct speech, and colons before direct speech. Students apply phonological, syllabic, morphological, and grammatical strategies to spell correctly.
