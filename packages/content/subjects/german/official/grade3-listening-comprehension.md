name: Listening Comprehension and Academic Language
description: Extract key information from subject-specific academic language, demonstrate comprehension through summaries, and understand how vocal and gestural elements support meaning
grade: 3
focus: Receptive listening and academic language processing
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Extract key information from texts using subject-specific academic language
  - Demonstrate comprehension by summarizing main ideas in own words
  - Identify how vocal elements (volume, pace, intonation) support understanding
  - Recognize how gestural elements (body language, facial expressions) convey meaning
  - Distinguish between essential information and supporting details in presentations
  - Apply focused attention strategies during extended listening tasks
problem_types:
  - Information extraction
  - Summary creation
  - Vocal element analysis
  - Gesture interpretation
  - Main idea synthesis
  - Detail categorization
  - Comprehension demonstration
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Short texts (3-5 sentences) with familiar academic vocabulary
    - Clear main ideas explicitly stated with obvious supporting details
    - Single vocal/gestural element to identify (e.g., volume changes only)
  medium:
    - Medium texts (6-8 sentences) mixing familiar and new academic terms
    - Main ideas requiring some inference from multiple details
    - Multiple vocal/gestural elements working together (pace + gestures)
  hard:
    - Extended texts (9-12 sentences) with complex academic language
    - Implicit main ideas requiring synthesis across entire text
    - Subtle vocal/gestural nuances affecting meaning interpretation
prerequisites:
  - grade2-retelling-stories
  - grade1-listening-comprehension
real_world_context:
  - Listening to science or social studies presentations from teachers and extracting key concepts
  - Understanding academic vocabulary during math problem explanations in class
  - Watching educational videos and summarizing the main learning points
  - Recognizing how a speaker's tone and gestures help clarify confusing instructions
  - Following multi-step project descriptions with subject-specific terminology
  - Listening to a museum guide explain an exhibit and identifying the three main facts
  - Understanding a librarian's book recommendation with new genre vocabulary
  - Following a coach's demonstration of a new game with specific rules and positions
  - Listening to a nature documentary narrator and summarizing what animals need to survive
  - Understanding a visiting author's explanation of their writing process and key techniques
  - Following a classmate's science experiment presentation and identifying the hypothesis and conclusion
  - Listening to recorded audio stories and recognizing how voice changes show different emotions
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid academic vocabulary beyond Grade 3 subject content
  - Don't use texts longer than 12 sentences for listening comprehension
  - Avoid ambiguous vocal/gestural cues with multiple interpretations
  - Don't combine more than 3 different academic concepts in one task
  - Avoid cultural or subject knowledge beyond typical Grade 3 curriculum
