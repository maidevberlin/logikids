## Task Variations

Choose ONE of these variations:

1. **Argument Structure Template**
   - Provide an argumentation template
   - Sections: **These** (Thesis) | **Argument 1 + Begründung** | **Argument 2 + Begründung** | **Argument 3 + Begründung** | **Schluss** (Conclusion)
   - Topic: "Should students have homework?" or "Should pets be allowed in school?"
   - Students fill in each section

2. **Building Strong Arguments**
   - Present weak arguments (just opinions, no reasons)
   - Students strengthen them by adding reasons and examples
   - Weak: "Longer breaks are better."
   - Strong: "Longer breaks are better, because students need time to rest. For example, after two hours of learning, children are tired and can't concentrate well."

3. **Thesis Statement Practice**
   - Provide topics
   - Students write clear thesis statements
   - Good thesis: states position clearly, is specific
   - Examples: "I believe school uniforms should be required because..." vs. "School uniforms are interesting."
   - Write 3-4 thesis statements on different topics

4. **Argument with Examples**
   - Write arguments that include concrete examples
   - Structure: **Argument** + **Begründung** (Reason) + **Beispiel** (Example)
   - Example: "Sport is important [argument], because it keeps us healthy [reason]. For example, children who play sports regularly have stronger hearts [example]."

5. **Pro and Contra Table**
   - Present a controversial topic
   - Create table: **Pro-Argumente** | **Contra-Argumente**
   - List 3-4 arguments for each side with reasons
   - Then choose a side and write a conclusion explaining why

6. **Conclusion Writing**
   - Provide thesis and 3 arguments
   - Students write an effective conclusion
   - Conclusion should: summarize position, reference main arguments, make final appeal
   - Practice with 2-3 different topics

7. **Counterargument Response**
   - Present opposing arguments
   - Students respond with their own arguments
   - Structure: "Einige sagen, dass... Aber ich denke, dass..."
   - Learn to acknowledge and refute opposing views
   - Practice respectful disagreement

8. **Complete Argumentative Text**
   - Choose a topic relevant to students
   - Topics: more sports in school, later start time, healthier cafeteria food
   - Write full argumentative text (8-10 sentences)
   - Include: clear thesis, 3 arguments with reasons, examples, conclusion
   - Use connecting words: *erstens, zweitens, außerdem, deshalb, zum Schluss*
