version_notes: Initial concept for Grade 10 literary essay writing
---

The literary essay at grade 10 requires students to move beyond basic interpretation to develop original, thesis-driven arguments about literary texts. Students must select and analyze textual evidence strategically, using literary terminology to support sophisticated interpretations.

This concept emphasizes the integration of close reading with broader thematic analysis, preparing students for the more advanced interpretive work required in Oberstufe. Essays should demonstrate both analytical rigor and clear, persuasive writing that engages meaningfully with literature.
