# Reading Digital Texts

Create tasks about reading and navigating digital texts for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Hypertext Navigation

Teach students to follow and use links effectively:

**Hypertext features**:
- **Links** - Clickable text or images leading to other pages
- **Menus** - Navigation bars with categories
- **Breadcrumbs** - Show where you are in site structure
- **Tabs** - Multiple pages open at once
- **Pop-ups** - Windows appearing over main content

**Link strategies**:

| Strategy | When to Use | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Follow immediately** | Link explains key term | Understand better |
| **Open in new tab** | Want to return to original | Save your place |
| **Skip for now** | Link goes off-topic | Stay focused |
| **Note for later** | Interesting but not urgent | Return when finished |

Create navigation tasks:
- "You're reading about {{topic}} and see a link to {{related_topic}}. Should you click it now or skip it? Why?"
- "You followed {{number}} links from the original article. How do you get back to where you started?"
- "This page has links to {{link_a}}, {{link_b}}, and {{link_c}}. Which helps answer your question about {{query}}?"

## Digital Text Structure

Understand how online content is organized:

**Common web page elements**:
- Header (site name, navigation)
- Main content area
- Sidebar (related links, ads)
- Footer (contact, legal info)
- Comments section
- Related articles
- Advertisement spaces

**Reading path**:
1. Scan headline and images
2. Read introduction/summary
3. Decide if relevant
4. Read main content if useful
5. Check links and resources

Create structure tasks:
- "Draw where you would find these on a webpage: {{element_list}}"
- "This sidebar has {{content_list}}. Which are helpful for your research and which are distractions?"
- "In what order should you read this webpage about {{topic}} to find {{specific_info}}?"

## Distinguishing Content from Advertising

Identify sponsored and promotional material:

**Ad indicators**:
- Label says "Ad," "Sponsored," or "Promoted"
- Different styling from main content
- Tries to sell something
- Uses emotional/exciting language
- Links to commercial sites

**Content vs. Ad comparison**:

| Content | Advertisement |
|---------|---------------|
| Informative purpose | Selling purpose |
| Neutral language | Persuasive language |
| Educational value | Commercial value |
| Cited sources | Marketing claims |

Create identification tasks:
- "Which of these is an ad and which is content: {{example_a}} vs {{example_b}}?"
- "What clues tell you this section is sponsored: {{text_sample}}?"
- "You're researching {{topic}}. Should you trust this source: {{description}}? Why or why not?"

## Evaluating Online Sources

Teach critical assessment of web information:

**CRAAP Test** (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose):

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Currency** | When was it published? Is it up-to-date? |
| **Relevance** | Does it answer my question? Right depth? |
| **Authority** | Who wrote it? Are they an expert? |
| **Accuracy** | Can I verify it? Are sources cited? |
| **Purpose** | Inform, sell, entertain, or persuade? |

**Red flags**:
- No author listed
- No date
- Lots of ads
- Poor grammar/spelling
- Extreme language
- No sources cited
- Anonymous website

Create evaluation tasks:
- "Website A about {{topic}} has {{features}}. Is it trustworthy? Use the CRAAP test."
- "Compare these two sources on {{subject}}. Which is more reliable: {{source_a}} or {{source_b}}?"
- "This article claims {{surprising_fact}}. What three things would you check before believing it?"

## Managing Multiple Sources

Coordinate information from various pages:

**Multi-source strategies**:
- Open tabs for each source
- Take notes with source info
- Compare information across sites
- Look for agreements and disagreements
- Synthesize into own understanding

**Keeping track**:
- Note URL or site name
- Record date accessed
- Write down key facts
- Mark which source said what

Create multi-source tasks:
- "You found different information about {{topic}} on three websites. How do you decide which is correct?"
- "Create a note-taking system for researching {{subject}} using {{number}} online sources."
- "Sites A and B agree that {{fact_a}}, but Site C says {{fact_b}}. What should you do?"

## Reading Multimedia Content

Integrate text, images, video, and audio:

**Digital elements**:
- Embedded videos
- Image galleries
- Audio clips
- Interactive diagrams
- Infographics
- Animations

**Multimedia reading approach**:
1. Read text first for context
2. View media for additional information
3. Read captions and descriptions
4. Note what media adds to text
5. Return to text with new understanding

Create multimedia tasks:
- "This article includes text and a {{media_type}}. In what order should you read/view them?"
- "What does the {{video/image/diagram}} add that the text doesn't explain?"
- "Compare learning about {{topic}} from text only vs. text with {{media}}. What's the difference?"

## Dealing with Distractions

Stay focused while reading online:

**Common digital distractions**:
- Pop-up ads
- Autoplay videos
- Notification sounds
- Flashing banners
- "Related articles" links
- Comments sections
- Social media buttons

**Focus strategies**:
- Close unnecessary tabs
- Mute tab audio
- Use ad blocker (with parent permission)
- Set a reading goal before starting
- Ignore unrelated suggestions
- Take notes to stay engaged
- Set time limit

Create focus tasks:
- "List three strategies to avoid distractions when researching {{topic}} online."
- "A video starts playing automatically while you read. What should you do?"
- "You keep clicking on 'related articles' and forget your original question about {{topic}}. How can you stay focused?"

## Interactive Features

Use digital tools effectively:

**Interactive elements**:
- Search boxes (find specific info)
- Filters (narrow results)
- Dropdowns (expand sections)
- Zoom tools (enlarge images)
- Translation (change language)
- Text-to-speech (listen instead of read)
- Highlighting/note tools

Create interaction tasks:
- "You need to find information about {{specific_detail}} in a long article. Which tool would help most?"
- "This website is in {{language}} but you can read {{other_language}}. What feature should you use?"
- "The diagram is too small to read. What should you do?"

## Screen Reading Strategies

Adapt to reading on devices:

**Differences from print**:
- Harder on eyes (take breaks)
- Easier to skim than focus
- Scroll vs. turn pages
- Backlit screen
- Can adjust text size
- Can search for keywords

**Digital reading tips**:
- Increase text size if needed
- Reduce screen brightness in dark
- Take 20-second breaks every 20 minutes
- Print important documents if possible
- Use "reader view" for clean text
- Adjust device for less glare

Create screen reading tasks:
- "After reading online for {{time}}, your eyes hurt. What three things could help?"
- "Which setting makes this article easier to read: {{option_a}} or {{option_b}}?"
- "You need to really understand this digital text for a test. What strategies would help?"

**Task variation**: Use realistic digital reading scenarios (researching for homework, reading news articles, following online instructions, using educational websites). Include both navigation skills and critical evaluation.
