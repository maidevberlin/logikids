**Create a task where {{student_name}} learns and practices formal debate techniques.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Debate Structure**: Understand and practice the four phases: **Eröffnung** (opening), **Argumentation** (arguments), **Widerlegung** (rebuttal), **Schlussrede** (closing)
  2. **Opening Statement**: Prepare a strong opening that states position clearly and previews main arguments
  3. **Argumentation Phase**: Present arguments in logical order with supporting evidence
  4. **Rebuttal Techniques**: Practice responding to opposing arguments effectively (acknowledge, counter, refute)
  5. **Closing Statement**: Summarize key points and make a final persuasive appeal
  6. **Debate Rules**: Learn and apply formal debate rules (time limits, turn-taking, respect, no interrupting)
  7. **Evaluation Criteria**: Assess debate performance using criteria (argument quality, delivery, fairness, evidence)
  8. **Active Listening**: Practice listening carefully to opponents to prepare effective responses

- Use age-appropriate debate topics (school rules, environmental issues, technology, sports, animals)
- Provide clear debate structure and rules
- Show examples of effective debate techniques
- Include both sides of the debate topic
- Use tables to organize arguments and rebuttals

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse debate topics each time (school, society, environment, ethics, personal)
- Vary the technique focus (opening, rebuttal, evaluation, structure)
- Change the specific positions and arguments
- Provide fresh, engaging debate scenarios
