Generate a task where {{childName}} practices reading simple words and short sentences using picture support and sound-by-sound decoding.

- Reading simple CVC words (consonant-vowel-consonant)
- Reading familiar words (Mama, Papa, Oma)
- Decoding words sound by sound
- Reading short sentences with picture support
- Matching words to pictures

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Simple Word Reading
Present {{num1}} simple words that the student can decode. Start with very short words and include familiar words.

Example words:
| Short Words | Familiar Words |
|-------------|----------------|
| am, im, um | Mama, Papa |
| an, in, Bus | Oma, Opa |
| rot, gut, ist | Ball, Auto |

Ask: *Read each word. What does it mean?*

### Variation 2: Picture-Sentence Matching
Show {{num1}} pictures and {{num1}} simple sentences. The student must match each sentence to the correct picture.

Example sentences:
- *Der Ball ist rot.*
- *Mama liest ein Buch.*
- *Das Auto fährt.*
- *Oma backt Kuchen.*

### Variation 3: Sound-by-Sound Decoding
Present {{num1}} words where the student must decode each word by saying each sound, then blending them together.

Example process:
- *M-a-m-a* → *Mama*
- *B-a-ll* → *Ball*
- *S-o-nn-e* → *Sonne*
- *O-m-a* → *Oma*

### Variation 4: Sentence Completion with Pictures
Show a picture and provide a sentence with one missing word. The student reads the sentence and fills in the missing word based on the picture.

Example:
- Picture of a red ball: *Der ___ ist rot.* (Ball)
- Picture of Mama reading: *___ liest ein Buch.* (Mama)
- Picture of a car: *Das ___ fährt.* (Auto)

### Variation 5: Word-Picture Connection
Display {{num1}} simple words and {{num2}} pictures (include some distractors). The student must read each word and find the matching picture.

Words: *Ball, Haus, Baum, Sonne, Auto*
Pictures: Show 6-7 pictures including the correct ones plus distractors

### Variation 6: Simple Reading Comprehension
Present a very short sentence (3-5 words). After reading, ask a simple comprehension question.

Example:
- Sentence: *Der Ball ist rot.*
- Question: *Welche Farbe hat der Ball?* (What color is the ball?)

Or:
- Sentence: *Oma backt Kuchen.*
- Question: *Wer backt?* (Who is baking?)

### Variation 7: Building Sentences from Words
Provide {{num1}} word cards in mixed order. The student must arrange them to form a correct sentence.

Example word cards:
- *ist, Ball, rot, Der* → *Der Ball ist rot.*
- *ein, liest, Mama, Buch* → *Mama liest ein Buch.*

### Variation 8: Reading with Expression
Present {{num1}} simple sentences with different ending punctuation (., !, ?). The student reads each sentence with the appropriate expression.

Examples:
- *Das ist mein Ball.* (statement)
- *Der Ball ist weg!* (exclamation)
- *Wo ist Mama?* (question)
