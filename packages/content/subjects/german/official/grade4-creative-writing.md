# Creative Writing

## Task Variations

Choose ONE of these variations:

1. **Perspective Change**
   - Provide a short story told from one perspective
   - Students rewrite from a different character's viewpoint
   - Example: "Little Red Riding Hood" from the wolf's perspective
   - Show how the same events look different to different characters

2. **Story Continuation**
   - Give an interesting story beginning
   - Students continue it with their own ideas
   - Beginning examples: "When I opened the mysterious box, I found...", "The door that was always locked suddenly stood open..."
   - Write 6-8 sentences continuing the story

3. **Changing Story Elements**
   - Take a familiar story
   - Change one element: setting, main character, or ending
   - Example: Cinderella set in modern times, or with a different ending
   - Explain how the change affects the story

4. **Literary Device Practice**
   - Focus on one technique: metaphors, similes, personification
   - Metaphor: "Her smile was sunshine."
   - Simile: "He ran like the wind."
   - Personification: "The trees whispered secrets."
   - Write a scene using 4-5 literary devices

5. **Genre Transformation**
   - Rewrite a scene in a different genre
   - Genres: scary, funny, mysterious, adventure
   - Example: Take a mundane event (walking to school) and make it mysterious
   - Show how word choice creates atmosphere

6. **Character Development**
   - Create a detailed character profile
   - Include: **Name**, **Age**, **Appearance**, **Personality**, **Fears**, **Dreams**, **Secret**
   - Write a scene showing (not telling) the character's personality
   - Example: Show bravery through actions, not by saying "he was brave"

7. **Dialogue-Driven Scene**
   - Write a scene that's mostly dialogue
   - Reveal character personalities through how they speak
   - Use dialogue tags and action: *sagte, flüsterte, rief, lachte*
   - Show emotions through speech patterns and word choice

8. **Five-Sense Description**
   - Describe a setting using all five senses
   - Include: what you see, hear, smell, taste, touch
   - Settings: a beach, a forest, a busy market, a cozy room
   - Create an immersive scene in 6-8 sentences
   - Avoid listing; weave senses into flowing description
