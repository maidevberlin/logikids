**Create a task where {{student_name}} analyzes a short story (Kurzgeschichte).**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Characteristics Identification**: Identify typical short story features (sudden beginning/unmittelbarer Einstieg, limited time/place, few characters, single event, open ending)
  2. **Turning Point Analysis**: Identify the crucial turning point (Wendepunkt/Peripetie) and explain how it changes the story
  3. **Open Ending Interpretation**: Interpret an open or ambiguous ending and discuss multiple possible meanings
  4. **Compressed Form**: Analyze how the story achieves much with few words (economy of language)
  5. **Character Insight**: Analyze how characters are revealed through actions and dialogue rather than description
  6. **Beginning Analysis**: Examine the "in medias res" opening and what it reveals
  7. **Symbolism**: Identify and interpret symbolic elements or objects in the story
  8. **Writing Practice**: Write your own short story following the genre conventions

- Provide a short story excerpt or complete short story (300-500 words)
- Use age-appropriate themes (family conflicts, friendship tests, moral dilemmas, unexpected encounters)
- Include clear examples of short story characteristics
- Show the turning point or crucial moment
- Use tables to compare short stories with novels or to organize analysis

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse short story themes each time (realistic, symbolic, surprising, thought-provoking)
- Vary the analytical focus (structure, turning point, ending, symbolism)
- Change the specific situations and characters
- Provide fresh, engaging short story examples
