# Summary

Create tasks about writing effective summaries for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Understanding Summary Purpose

Teach what summaries are and when to use them:

**Summary** = Short version keeping only the most important information

**When we summarize**:
- Taking notes from textbooks
- Explaining a movie to a friend
- Writing book reports
- Reviewing for tests
- Reporting news events
- Describing what happened

**Summary characteristics**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Brief** | Much shorter than original |
| **Main ideas only** | No minor details |
| **Own words** | Not copied from text |
| **Objective** | Facts, not opinions |
| **Complete** | Includes all key points |

Create purpose tasks:
- "Which is a summary and which is a retelling: {{option_a}} vs {{option_b}}?"
- "Why would you write a summary of {{text_type}}?"
- "This summary is too long/too short/just right for the original {{page_count}} text. Why?"

## Identifying Main Ideas

Distinguish essential from unimportant information:

**Main idea markers**:
- Who is the main character/subject?
- What is the main event/topic?
- Where and when (if crucial)?
- Why did it happen/matter?
- What was the result/conclusion?

**Details to skip**:
- Minor characters
- Exact quotes (unless crucial)
- Descriptive details
- Background information
- Examples (keep one if needed)
- Repeated information

| Keep | Skip |
|------|------|
| Main character's name | What they wore |
| Central conflict | Minor disagreements |
| Story resolution | Detailed descriptions |
| Key facts | Supporting examples |

Create identification tasks:
- "Mark which sentences are main ideas (M) and which are details (D) in this paragraph."
- "This text has {{number}} paragraphs. What's the main idea of each?"
- "Which information is essential for the summary: {{detail_a}}, {{detail_b}}, or {{detail_c}}?"

## Using Own Words

Avoid copying - paraphrase instead:

**Why paraphrase?**
- Shows you understand
- Avoids plagiarism
- Makes summary clearer
- Tests comprehension

**Paraphrasing strategies**:
- Use synonyms (big → large, said → explained)
- Change sentence structure
- Combine information differently
- Shorten long phrases

**Original vs. Paraphrase**:
- Original: "The exhausted hikers finally reached the mountain peak after climbing for six hours."
- Copied (wrong): "The exhausted hikers finally reached the mountain peak."
- Paraphrased (good): "After six hours of climbing, the tired hikers made it to the top."

Create paraphrasing tasks:
- "Rewrite this sentence in your own words: {{original_sentence}}"
- "This summary copies too much from the original. Fix it: {{copied_summary}}"
- "Find three synonyms for {{word}} to use in your summary."

## Summary Structure

Organize summary logically:

**Basic structure**:
1. **Opening** - State topic and source
2. **Body** - Main points in order
3. **Conclusion** - Final outcome or main message

**Story summary order**:
- Beginning: Who, where, when, problem
- Middle: Main events, turning point
- End: How it was resolved

**Informational text summary order**:
- Topic sentence (what it's about)
- Main points (in order or by importance)
- Conclusion (key takeaway)

Create structure tasks:
- "Organize these main ideas in the correct order for a summary: {{scrambled_points}}"
- "Write an opening sentence for a summary of {{text_title}}."
- "Which summary is better organized: {{summary_a}} or {{summary_b}}? Why?"

## Appropriate Length

Match summary length to purpose:

**Length guidelines**:

| Original Length | Summary Length |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 paragraph | 1-2 sentences |
| 1 page | 3-5 sentences |
| 1 chapter | 1 paragraph |
| 1 book | 1-2 paragraphs |

**Rule of thumb**: Summary should be about 1/3 to 1/4 of original length

Create length tasks:
- "This {{original_length}} text needs a summary. How many sentences should you write?"
- "Your summary is {{count}} sentences for a {{count}} paragraph text. Is this appropriate?"
- "Make this summary shorter while keeping the main ideas: {{too_long_summary}}"

## Objective Tone

Keep opinions out of summaries:

**Objective (facts only)**:
- "The character decided to leave town."
- "The experiment showed that plants need light."
- "The story takes place in a village."

**Subjective (includes opinions - wrong for summaries)**:
- "The character foolishly decided to leave town."
- "The amazing experiment proved that..."
- "The story takes place in a beautiful village."

**Opinion words to avoid**:
- Beautiful, ugly, boring, exciting
- Should, must, need to
- Good, bad, terrible, wonderful
- Fortunately, unfortunately, sadly
- Interesting, strange, weird

Create objectivity tasks:
- "Remove the opinion words from this summary: {{subjective_summary}}"
- "Which summary is objective: {{option_a}} or {{option_b}}?"
- "Rewrite this sentence without opinion: 'The boring character walked slowly through the pretty forest.'"

## Step-by-Step Summary Process

Guide students through summary writing:

**5-step process**:
1. **Read** the text carefully (maybe twice)
2. **Identify** main ideas (underline or list)
3. **Note** the order of events or topics
4. **Write** in your own words
5. **Check** - did you include all key points?

**Self-checking questions**:
- Does my summary make sense alone?
- Did I use my own words?
- Did I include all main points?
- Did I skip the details?
- Is it much shorter than the original?
- Did I keep it objective?

Create process tasks:
- "Follow the 5 steps to summarize this text: {{short_text}}"
- "Check this summary using the 6 questions. What needs fixing?"
- "Your classmate's summary has {{problem}}. Which step did they skip?"

## Different Text Types

Adapt summary approach to genre:

**Story summaries** include:
- Main characters
- Setting (briefly)
- Problem/conflict
- Key events
- Solution/ending

**Informational text summaries** include:
- Main topic
- Key facts
- Important supporting details
- Conclusion or result

**News article summaries** include:
- Who, what, when, where
- Why it happened
- What it means
- What happens next (if known)

Create genre-specific tasks:
- "Summarize this {{genre}} text following the {{genre}}-specific guidelines."
- "What elements are essential for summarizing a {{text_type}}?"
- "Compare summaries of a story vs. an informational text. What's different?"

## Common Summary Mistakes

Identify and correct typical errors:

**Mistake 1**: Too detailed
- Problem: Including minor facts
- Fix: Focus only on main ideas

**Mistake 2**: Copying text
- Problem: Using exact words from original
- Fix: Paraphrase completely

**Mistake 3**: Adding opinions
- Problem: "I think..." or value judgments
- Fix: Stick to objective facts

**Mistake 4**: Missing key points
- Problem: Incomplete summary
- Fix: Reread and check against original

**Mistake 5**: Wrong order
- Problem: Events jumbled
- Fix: Follow original sequence

Create error correction tasks:
- "This summary has {{mistake_type}}. How would you fix it?"
- "Find three problems with this summary: {{flawed_summary}}"
- "Which mistake did the writer make: too detailed, copied, or added opinion?"

**Task variation**: Use various text types (fables, news articles, informational paragraphs, short stories, instructions). Progress from very short texts (one paragraph) to longer ones (multiple pages).
