**Create a task where {{student_name}} writes or analyzes a factual report (Bericht).**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **W-Questions Structure**: Write a report ensuring all W-questions are answered (Wer? Was? Wann? Wo? Warum? Wie?)
  2. **Objective Writing**: Transform a subjective or emotional account into an objective, factual report
  3. **Report Structure**: Follow proper report structure (headline, introduction, main part with facts, conclusion)
  4. **Fact Selection**: Select and organize relevant facts from multiple sources or notes
  5. **Neutral Language**: Practice using neutral, objective language (avoiding emotional words and opinions)
  6. **Time Sequence**: Present events in chronological order using appropriate time markers
  7. **Report Analysis**: Read a report and check if it's complete, objective, and well-structured
  8. **Present Tense**: Use **Präsens** (present tense) appropriately for reports about current or recent events

- Use age-appropriate report topics (school events, sports competitions, field trips, accidents, discoveries)
- Provide scenario details or source material (eyewitness accounts, notes, observations)
- Show difference between subjective accounts and objective reports
- Use clear, factual language
- Include tables to organize W-question information

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse report topics each time (school, sports, community, accidents, events)
- Vary the writing challenge (from notes, from experience, transforming subjective to objective)
- Change the specific events and contexts
- Provide fresh, engaging report scenarios
