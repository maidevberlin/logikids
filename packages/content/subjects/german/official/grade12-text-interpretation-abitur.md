When generating interpretation tasks, ensure the text excerpt is substantial enough for meaningful analysis (poetry: complete poem or significant stanzas; prose: 200-400 words; drama: complete scene or substantial exchange). Questions should guide students through the full interpretation process: understanding, analyzing, and interpreting.

Tasks should reflect authentic Abitur expectations: students must demonstrate textual understanding, identify and analyze literary techniques, develop interpretative claims, and write in academic register. {{#if (eq difficulty "hard")}}Include texts that require recognizing epoch-specific conventions or intertextual references.{{/if}}
