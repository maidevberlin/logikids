# Conducting Interviews

Create tasks about preparing and conducting interviews for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Question Preparation

Teach students to develop effective interview questions:

**W-Questions (Five W's)**:
- **Who?** - About people involved
- **What?** - About events, activities, facts
- **When?** - About time, dates, sequence
- **Where?** - About locations, places
- **Why?** - About reasons, motivations
- **How?** - About methods, processes

**Question Types**:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Open questions** | Get detailed answers | "What do you enjoy most about your hobby?" |
| **Closed questions** | Get specific facts | "How many years have you been doing this?" |
| **Follow-up questions** | Go deeper | "You mentioned challenges—can you tell me more?" |

Create preparation tasks:
- "You will interview {{person}} about {{topic}}. Write three open questions and two closed questions."
- "Turn this closed question into an open question: '{{closed_question}}'"
- "Which question would give you more interesting information: {{option_a}} or {{option_b}}? Explain why."

## Interview Structure

Guide students in organizing interviews:

**Three-part structure**:
1. **Introduction** (greeting, explain purpose)
2. **Main questions** (organized by topic)
3. **Conclusion** (thank you, final thoughts)

**Organizing questions by topic**:
- Group related questions together
- Start with easy, friendly questions
- Save difficult or personal questions for later
- End with interesting, forward-looking questions

Create planning tasks:
- "You have these {{number}} questions about {{topic}}. Put them in a logical order and explain your choice."
- "Write an opening sentence for an interview with {{interviewee}} about {{subject}}."
- "What topic areas would you cover in an interview about {{theme}}? List at least three."

## Active Listening Skills

Develop responsive interview techniques:

**Listening strategies**:
- Make eye contact
- Nod to show understanding
- Don't interrupt
- Notice interesting details for follow-up
- Remember what was said earlier

**Follow-up questions**:
- "You mentioned {{detail}}. Can you explain more about that?"
- "That's interesting! What happened next?"
- "How did you feel when {{event}}?"
- "Why did you decide to {{action}}?"

Create listening tasks:
- "{{Interviewee}} says: '{{answer}}'. What follow-up question could you ask?"
- "Listen to this interview response. Identify two details you could ask about."
- "Which response shows good active listening: {{option_a}} or {{option_b}}? Why?"

## Documentation Methods

Teach students to record interview information:

**Note-taking strategies**:
- Write keywords, not full sentences
- Use abbreviations
- Mark important points with *
- Leave space for additions
- Note interesting quotes exactly

**Recording options**:

| Method | Advantages | Challenges |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Written notes** | Practice writing, selective focus | Can't catch everything |
| **Voice recording** | Complete record | Need to listen again, transcribe |
| **Video** | Captures body language | Technical setup, privacy |

Create documentation tasks:
- "Read this interview excerpt. Which three keywords would you write down?"
- "{{Interviewee}} said: '{{long_quote}}'. Shorten this to a brief note keeping the main idea."
- "You're interviewing {{person}} about {{topic}}. What method would you use to document it? Explain your choice."

## Interview Etiquette

Teach polite and respectful interview behavior:

**Do's**:
- Arrive on time
- Introduce yourself clearly
- Ask permission to record
- Thank the person for their time
- Stay focused on the topic
- Be respectful of personal boundaries

**Don'ts**:
- Don't ask rude or too personal questions
- Don't argue with answers
- Don't make the interviewee uncomfortable
- Don't share private information without permission

Create etiquette scenarios:
- "Before starting your interview with {{person}}, what three things should you do?"
- "{{Interviewee}} seems uncomfortable with your question about {{topic}}. What should you do?"
- "Is this an appropriate interview question: '{{question}}'? Why or why not?"

## Different Interview Purposes

Explore various interview contexts:

**Interview types**:
- *Personal interest*: Family history, hobbies, experiences
- *Expert knowledge*: Professional skills, specialized topics
- *Research*: Gathering information for projects
- *Opinion*: Views on issues, preferences
- *Biography*: Life story, important events

Create purpose-based tasks:
- "You're interviewing {{person_type}} for {{purpose}}. What three main topics would you cover?"
- "Compare these two interview questions for a {{purpose}} interview: {{question_a}} vs {{question_b}}. Which fits better?"
- "Write two questions for a biographical interview with {{interesting_person}}."

## Processing Interview Results

Guide students in using interview information:

**Post-interview steps**:
1. Review notes/recordings soon after
2. Organize information by topic
3. Identify most important points
4. Find good quotes
5. Think about what's missing

**Presenting findings**:
- Write interview summary
- Create question-and-answer format
- Make presentation about interviewee
- Share interesting facts learned

Create processing tasks:
- "You interviewed {{person}} about {{topic}}. Here are your notes: {{note_list}}. Write a short summary highlighting the three most interesting points."
- "Which quote from {{interviewee}} would be best for your project about {{theme}}: '{{quote_a}}' or '{{quote_b}}'?"
- "Based on your interview with {{expert}}, what new question do you wish you had asked?"

## Practice Scenarios

Provide realistic interview situations:

Example interviewees:
- School principal about new playground
- Grandparent about childhood
- Local athlete about training
- Librarian about favorite books
- Chef about cooking
- Pet owner about animal care
- Artist about creative process

Create scenario-based tasks:
- "Create a 5-question interview plan for {{interviewee}} about {{specific_topic}}."
- "You're interviewing {{person}} but they give very short answers. How can you encourage them to say more?"
- "During your interview with {{expert}}, they mention {{unexpected_topic}}. What follow-up question would you ask?"

**Task variation**: Use different interview purposes, interviewees, topics, and documentation methods. Include planning, conducting, and processing stages.
