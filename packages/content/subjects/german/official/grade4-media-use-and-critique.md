# Media Use and Critique

Create tasks about analyzing and evaluating media critically for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Personal Media Reflection

Guide students to examine their own media habits:

**Media types to consider**:
- Television (shows, movies, news)
- Internet (websites, videos, games)
- Gaming (console, computer, mobile)
- Reading (books, magazines, digital)
- Music (streaming, radio)
- Social media (age-appropriate platforms)

**Reflection questions**:

| Aspect | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Time** | How much time daily? Which media most? |
| **Purpose** | Entertainment? Learning? Communication? |
| **Feelings** | How do you feel during and after? |
| **Choice** | Who decides what you watch/play/read? |

Create reflection tasks:
- "List all the media you used yesterday. How much time did you spend on each?"
- "What's your favorite {{media_type}}? Why do you enjoy it? How does it make you feel?"
- "Compare a weekday and weekend. How does your media use differ?"

## Evaluating Information Sources

Teach critical evaluation of media content:

**Trust indicators**:
- *Reliable source*: Known organization, expert author, recent date
- *Questionable source*: Unknown author, no date, lots of ads, emotional language

**Fact-checking strategies**:
1. Check the author (Who wrote this? Are they an expert?)
2. Check the date (Is this current information?)
3. Check other sources (Do other places say the same thing?)
4. Check the evidence (Are there facts, not just opinions?)

Create evaluation tasks:
- "You find this information about {{topic}}: {{content_snippet}}. List three things you would check to see if it's trustworthy."
- "Website A says {{claim_a}}. Website B says {{claim_b}}. How would you find out which is correct?"
- "Is this a fact or an opinion: '{{statement}}'? How can you tell?"

## Recognizing Persuasion Techniques

Identify how media tries to influence us:

**Common techniques**:

| Technique | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Emotional appeal** | Makes you feel something | Happy families in ads |
| **Celebrity endorsement** | Famous person recommends it | Athlete promoting shoes |
| **Bandwagon** | "Everyone's doing it!" | "Most popular game!" |
| **Repetition** | Hear it many times | Repeated jingle or slogan |
| **Fear** | Warns of bad consequences | "Don't miss out!" |
| **Exaggeration** | Makes claims seem bigger | "Best ever!" "Amazing!" |

Create recognition tasks:
- "This ad shows {{description}}. Which persuasion technique is being used?"
- "A commercial says: '{{quote}}'. Why does the advertiser use this language?"
- "Compare these two ads for {{product}}. What techniques does each use to convince you?"

## Media Messages and Values

Analyze what media teaches implicitly:

**Hidden messages about**:
- What's considered important or valuable
- How people should look or act
- What makes someone successful or popular
- Gender roles and stereotypes
- What's "normal" or desirable

Create analysis tasks:
- "In the show {{title}}, {{character_type}} characters are usually shown as {{traits}}. What message does this send?"
- "This advertisement shows {{scene_description}}. What does it suggest about {{theme}}?"
- "Count how many {{character_type}} appear in this {{media}} vs. how many {{other_character_type}}. What do you notice?"

## Healthy Media Habits

Develop balanced media use strategies:

**Guidelines for healthy use**:
- Set time limits (agree with family)
- Take regular breaks
- Balance screen time with other activities
- Choose age-appropriate content
- Think before sharing online
- Talk about what you see/read

**Red flags** (when to ask an adult):
- Something makes you uncomfortable
- Someone asks for personal information
- You see something violent or scary
- You're being contacted by strangers
- Something seems too good to be true

Create habit-building tasks:
- "Create a daily media schedule that includes {{screen_time}} of screen time and {{other_time}} for other activities."
- "Your friend spends {{excessive_time}} gaming daily and seems tired at school. What advice would you give?"
- "You see {{concerning_content}} online. What should you do?"

## Comparing Media Formats

Understand how different media present information:

**Format characteristics**:

| Format | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **TV news** | Visual, current | Brief, chosen by editors |
| **Newspaper** | Detailed, researched | Text-heavy, yesterday's news |
| **Website** | Interactive, updated | Variable quality |
| **Social media** | Fast, personal views | Unverified, biased |
| **Books** | Thorough, in-depth | Takes time, may be outdated |

Create comparison tasks:
- "The same event is reported on {{format_a}} and {{format_b}}. What's different in how they present it?"
- "You want to learn about {{current_topic}}. Which media format would be best? Why?"
- "This social media post says {{claim}}. What other source would you check?"

## Privacy and Safety

Teach responsible online behavior:

**Personal information to protect**:
- Full name, address, phone number
- School name, location
- Passwords
- Photos showing identifying details
- Family information
- Current location

**Safe online practices**:
- Use privacy settings
- Think before posting (public forever!)
- Be kind in comments
- Don't respond to mean messages
- Tell a trusted adult about problems
- Question friend requests from strangers

Create safety scenarios:
- "Someone you don't know sends this message: '{{message}}'. What should you do?"
- "Your friend wants to post a photo of you both at {{location}}. What should you consider?"
- "A website asks for your {{personal_info}} to enter a contest. Is this safe? Why or why not?"

## Active vs. Passive Media Use

Distinguish between different types of engagement:

**Passive use**: Watching, scrolling, consuming
- Can be relaxing
- Easy entertainment
- May feel empty after

**Active use**: Creating, learning, interacting meaningfully
- More satisfying
- Develops skills
- Feels purposeful

Create engagement tasks:
- "Which is more active media use: {{activity_a}} or {{activity_b}}? Explain."
- "Turn this passive activity into an active one: watching {{show_type}} → {{active_version}}"
- "You spent {{time}} on {{media}}. Did you create anything, learn anything, or connect with anyone? How could you make it more active?"

**Task variation**: Use different media types, current topics relevant to students' lives, and real-world scenarios they might encounter. Balance critical thinking with practical safety skills.
