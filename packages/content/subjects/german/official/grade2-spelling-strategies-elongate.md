Generate a task where {{childName}} practices the elongation (stretching) strategy to hear and spell all sounds in words clearly.

**Focus areas to choose from:**
- Stretching words to hear all sounds
- Identifying sounds that might be missed when speaking normally
- Using elongation to spell correctly
- Hearing short vs. long vowels through elongation
- Writing words after elongating them

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Stretch and Spell
Present {{num1}} words. The student must say each word in elongated form, then write all the letters they hear.

Example words:
| Normal Word | Elongated | Letters Heard |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| *Rad* | Raaaaaaad | R-a-d |
| *Hand* | Haaaaaand | H-a-n-d |
| *Brot* | Broooooot | B-r-o-t |
| *Wald* | Waaaaaald | W-a-l-d |

### Variation 2: Missing Sound Detection
Show {{num1}} words spelled incorrectly because a sound was missed. The student must elongate the word to find the missing letter.

Examples:
- *Hal* (should be *Hall*) → Elongate: Haaaaaall
- *Wan* (should be *Wand*) → Elongate: Waaaaaand
- *Bal* (should be *Ball*) → Elongate: Baaaaaall

### Variation 3: Vowel Length Identification
Present {{num1}} words. The student elongates each word to determine if the vowel is short or long.

Example words:
| Word | Elongate | Vowel Sound |
|------|----------|-------------|
| *Rad* | Raaaad | Long a (ā) |
| *Ratte* | Ratte | Short a (ă) |
| *Brot* | Broooot | Long o (ō) |
| *Rock* | Rock | Short o (ŏ) |

### Variation 4: Consonant Cluster Practice
Show {{num1}} words with consonant clusters (st, sp, nd, ng). Student elongates to hear each sound in the cluster.

Example words:
- *Stand* → Staaaaaaand (hear S-t-a-n-d)
- *Strand* → Straaaaaaand (hear S-t-r-a-n-d)
- *Spring* → Spriiiiiing (hear S-p-r-i-ng)
- *Wald* → Waaaaaald (hear W-a-l-d)

### Variation 5: Spell Check with Elongation
Provide {{num1}} words spelled by a fictional student with some errors. The real student uses elongation to check if the spelling is correct.

Examples:
- *Han* for *Hand* → Elongate: Haaaaaand → Missing 'd'! ✗
- *Brot* for *Brot* → Elongate: Broooooot → Correct! ✓
- *Rad* for *Rad* → Elongate: Raaaaaaad → Correct! ✓

### Variation 6: Write What You Hear
Say {{num1}} words aloud in elongated form. The student writes down what they hear.

Examples (spoken slowly):
- *Laaaaaaand* → Student writes: *Land*
- *Haaaaaaand* → Student writes: *Hand*
- *Wiiiiiiind* → Student writes: *Wind*
- *Straaaaaand* → Student writes: *Strand*

### Variation 7: Before and After Elongation
Show {{num1}} words. The student must:
1. Read the word normally
2. Say it in elongated form
3. Write all sounds they hear

Example:
1. *Wald* (normal)
2. *Waaaaaald* (elongated)
3. Write: *W-a-l-d*

### Variation 8: Partner Syllable Elongation
For longer words, combine syllable division with elongation. The student elongates each syllable separately.

Examples:
- *Regenschirm* → *Re-gen-schirm*
  - Elongate: *Reeeee* → *geeeeen* → *schiiiirm*
- *Schmetterling* → *Schmet-ter-ling*
  - Elongate: *Schmeeeet* → *terrrr* → *liiiing*

This helps hear sounds within each syllable clearly.
