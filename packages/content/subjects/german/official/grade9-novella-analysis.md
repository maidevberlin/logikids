  - Recognize and interpret the Dingsymbol (object symbol) and its significance to the narrative
  - Analyze frame narratives and their structural function in novellas
  - Compare novellas with short stories and novels to understand genre distinctions
  - Examine the central conflict and its resolution within the novella structure
  - Write interpretations that focus on genre-specific elements and their literary effects
problem_types:
  - Genre identification
  - Symbol interpretation
  - Frame narrative analysis
  - Conflict examination
  - Genre comparison
  - Structural analysis
  - Unerhörte Begebenheit identification
  - Narrative perspective evaluation
  - Literary device recognition

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Clear frame narratives with straightforward inner and outer stories
    - Easily identifiable Dingsymbole with obvious symbolic meanings
    - Unerhörte Begebenheiten that are explicitly dramatic or unusual
  medium:
    - Complex frame structures requiring careful tracking of narrative levels
    - Symbols requiring deeper interpretation and textual evidence
    - Analysis of how genre conventions create specific literary effects
  hard:
    - Subtle or implicit frame narratives requiring close reading
    - Multiple symbols or ambiguous symbolic meanings requiring synthesis
    - Comparative analysis across different novellas or epochs
prerequisites:
  - grade8-short-story-interpretation
  - grade8-narrative-techniques
real_world_context:
  - Literary scholars study how Storm's novellas use Dingsymbole to concentrate narrative meaning in physical objects throughout the story
  - Students compare novellas to novels by analyzing how both genres handle extended narrative but with different structural approaches
  - Analyzing frame narratives helps understand how stories within stories create distance and perspective in works like Keller's novellas
  - Identifying the unerhörte Begebenheit reveals what makes a novella's central event extraordinary rather than everyday
  - Comparative literature courses examine how the German novella tradition differs from Anglo-American short fiction
  - Film adaptations of novellas must decide whether to preserve the frame narrative structure or present the story linearly
  - Understanding genre conventions helps readers set appropriate expectations when encountering novellas in anthologies
  - Writers studying the novella form learn how concentrated symbolism can carry thematic weight more efficiently than extended metaphor
  - Literary critics analyze how 19th-century novellas reflected social tensions through their unerhörte Begebenheiten
  - Students recognize novella characteristics in contemporary works that adapt the traditional form to modern settings
  - Translation studies examine how Dingsymbole maintain or lose symbolic resonance across different languages and cultures
  - Analyzing conflict resolution in novellas reveals how the genre balances dramatic intensity with narrative brevity
  - Theater adaptations must condense the novella's narrative while preserving its symbolic elements and central conflict
  - Understanding frame narratives illuminates how novellas create narrative authority through embedded storytelling
  - Readers appreciate how novellas occupy a unique middle ground between the compression of short stories and the scope of novels
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using novellas longer than 100 pages or complex multi-plot structures
  - Do not conflate novella with Kurzgeschichte characteristics
  - Avoid texts where the Dingsymbol is absent or purely decorative
  - Don't use contemporary fiction lacking traditional novella features
  - Avoid analysis requiring knowledge of entire novels or dramatic works
