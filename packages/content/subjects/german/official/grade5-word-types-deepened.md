**Create a task where {{student_name}} identifies, analyzes, and works with different word types (**Wortarten**).**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Word Type Identification**: Identify all word types in a sentence or text (**Nomen, Verb, Adjektiv, Artikel, Pronomen, Präposition, Konjunktion, Adverb**)
  2. **Inflectable vs. Non-inflectable**: Distinguish **flektierbare** (changeable: nouns, verbs, adjectives) from **unflektierbare** (unchangeable: adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions) word types
  3. **Content vs. Function Words**: Distinguish **Inhaltswörter** (content words: nouns, verbs, adjectives) from **Funktionswörter** (function words: articles, prepositions, conjunctions)
  4. **Noun Analysis**: Deep dive into nouns (gender, case, number, compound/simple)
  5. **Verb Analysis**: Analyze verbs (person, number, tense, mood, infinitive vs. conjugated)
  6. **Adjective Analysis**: Work with adjectives (comparison forms, declension, attributive vs. predicative)
  7. **Pronoun Types**: Distinguish pronoun types (**Personal-, Possessiv-, Demonstrativ-, Relativpronomen**)
  8. **Word Type Functions**: Explain what role each word type plays in a sentence

- Use clear, age-appropriate example sentences
- Provide varied sentence contexts
- Use tables to organize word types and their characteristics
- Include examples of inflection (changing forms)
- Show how word types work together in sentences

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse sentence content each time (different topics and situations)
- Vary the word type focus (all types, specific types, comparisons)
- Change the complexity level (simple to complex analysis)
- Provide fresh, engaging examples
