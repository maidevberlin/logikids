# Presentation with Media

Create tasks about creating and delivering presentations with media support for {{grade}}. graders (ages {{age}}).

Generate varied content using these guidelines:

## Slide Design Basics

Teach effective presentation slide creation:

**Slide structure**:

| Slide Type | Purpose | Content |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Title slide** | Introduction | Topic, name, date |
| **Content slide** | Main information | Key points, images |
| **Conclusion slide** | Summary | Main takeaways, thank you |

**Design principles**:
- *Keep it simple*: Not too much text per slide
- *Use images*: Pictures help explain ideas
- *Readable fonts*: Large, clear text
- *Consistent style*: Same colors and layout
- *One idea per slide*: Don't overcrowd

Create design tasks:
- "You're creating a presentation about {{topic}}. List what should go on each of your {{number}} slides."
- "This slide has {{problem}}. How would you improve it?"
- "Choose the better slide design for presenting {{information}}: {{option_a}} or {{option_b}}? Why?"

## Text and Images Balance

Guide students in combining words and pictures:

**Text guidelines**:
- Bullet points, not paragraphs
- 3-5 points per slide maximum
- Keywords, not full sentences
- Large enough to read from distance

**Image guidelines**:
- Related to the content
- High quality, not pixelated
- Properly credited if needed
- Adds information, not just decoration

Create balance tasks:
- "Your slide says: {{long_paragraph}}. Reduce this to 3-4 bullet points."
- "You're explaining {{concept}}. What image would help your audience understand?"
- "This slide has {{text_amount}} and {{image_amount}}. Is it well-balanced? How could you improve it?"

## Creating Effective Handouts

Teach supplementary material design:

**Handout purposes**:
- Summary of main points
- Additional details not on slides
- Resources for further learning
- Space for audience notes

**Handout elements**:
- Clear title
- Organized sections
- Key information highlighted
- Contact or reference information

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Title** | What the presentation is about |
| **Main points** | 3-5 key takeaways |
| **Visuals** | Important diagrams/images |
| **Resources** | Where to learn more |

Create handout tasks:
- "Create a handout outline for your presentation on {{topic}}. What three main points will you include?"
- "Your handout should support your slides, not repeat them. What additional information would you add?"
- "Design a one-page handout for {{subject}} that includes {{required_elements}}."

## Coordinating Speech and Slides

Practice timing and transitions:

**Presentation structure**:
1. **Introduction** - Greet audience, state topic
2. **Body** - Present main points (one per slide)
3. **Conclusion** - Summarize, invite questions

**Slide transitions**:
- Announce before changing slides
- "Let's move on to..."
- "Next, we'll look at..."
- "Now I'll show you..."

**Timing tips**:
- 1-2 minutes per slide
- Don't read slides word-for-word
- Look at audience, not screen
- Pause between slides

Create coordination tasks:
- "Write what you would say when moving from slide {{number}} (about {{topic_a}}) to slide {{number + 1}} (about {{topic_b}})."
- "Your presentation is {{time}} minutes with {{number}} slides. How long should you spend on each slide?"
- "You have this slide: {{slide_content}}. Write what you would say about it without just reading it."

## Using Presentation Tools

Introduce basic software features:

**Common tools**:
- PowerPoint
- Google Slides
- Keynote
- Prezi

**Basic features to use**:

| Feature | When to Use | Tips |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Templates** | Start presentation | Choose simple, professional |
| **Text boxes** | Add content | Keep fonts consistent |
| **Images** | Visual support | Use copyright-free sources |
| **Transitions** | Between slides | Simple, not distracting |
| **Animations** | Emphasize points | Use sparingly |

Create tool usage tasks:
- "You want to show {{information}} appearing one point at a time. Which feature would you use?"
- "Choose an appropriate template for a presentation about {{serious_topic}}: {{formal_option}} or {{playful_option}}?"
- "Your image is too {{problem}}. What tool feature can fix this?"

## Audience Engagement

Teach interactive presentation techniques:

**Engagement strategies**:
- Ask questions during presentation
- Include interactive elements
- Use relevant examples
- Make eye contact
- Show enthusiasm for topic
- Invite questions at end

**Interactive elements**:
- Polls or quick questions
- Show-and-tell objects
- Short demonstrations
- Before/after comparisons

Create engagement tasks:
- "You're presenting about {{topic}}. Write two questions you could ask your audience to keep them engaged."
- "How could you make a presentation about {{dry_topic}} more interesting for your classmates?"
- "Plan one interactive moment for your {{subject}} presentation. What would you do?"

## Technical Preparation

Guide students in avoiding technical problems:

**Before presentation**:
- Test equipment (projector, computer)
- Have backup plan (printed slides)
- Practice advancing slides
- Check all links and videos
- Bring own device if possible

**During presentation**:
- Know how to connect equipment
- Have presenter notes ready
- Know how to skip or go back
- Don't panic if tech fails

Create preparation tasks:
- "List three things you should test before your presentation starts."
- "Your video won't play during the presentation. What should you do?"
- "Create a backup plan for presenting {{topic}} if the projector doesn't work."

## Practice and Rehearsal

Develop presentation skills:

**Practice methods**:
- Present to family/friends
- Record yourself
- Practice in front of mirror
- Time your presentation
- Rehearse transitions

**What to practice**:
- Speaking clearly and loudly
- Not saying "um" or "like"
- Making eye contact
- Using natural gestures
- Advancing slides smoothly
- Handling questions

Create practice tasks:
- "You keep saying 'um' when presenting. What three strategies could help you stop?"
- "Practice explaining slide {{number}} in {{time}} seconds. What will you say?"
- "Record yourself presenting {{section}}. List two things you did well and one thing to improve."

## Different Presentation Types

Explore various presentation purposes:

**Presentation formats**:
- *Informative*: Teaching about a topic
- *Persuasive*: Convincing audience
- *Demonstrative*: Showing how to do something
- *Storytelling*: Sharing an experience

Create format-specific tasks:
- "You're giving a {{format}} presentation about {{topic}}. What should your main slide be?"
- "Compare an informative vs. persuasive presentation about {{subject}}. How would the slides differ?"
- "Your {{format}} presentation needs to {{goal}}. What media would help: {{options}}?"

**Task variation**: Use different topics relevant to students (animals, hobbies, school subjects, environmental issues, technology). Include both planning and execution of presentations with various media tools.
