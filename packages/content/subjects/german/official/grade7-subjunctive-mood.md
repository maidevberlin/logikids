name: Subjunctive Mood (Konjunktiv)
description: Using subjunctive I and II for indirect speech, reported speech, and expressing hypothetical or contrary-to-fact situations
grade: 7
focus: Verb moods and their communicative effects
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Distinguish between verb moods (indicative, subjunctive, imperative) and their functions in communication
  - Form and use subjunctive I (Konjunktiv I) correctly for reported speech and formal statements
  - Form and use subjunctive II (Konjunktiv II) for hypothetical situations, wishes, and polite requests
  - Convert direct speech to indirect speech using appropriate subjunctive forms
  - Recognize the connection between subjunctive use and communicative intention (distance, politeness, doubt)
  - Identify and interpret subjunctive mood in literary and journalistic texts
  - Apply subjunctive forms to express conditions, wishes, and unreality in written and spoken communication
problem_types:
  - Mood identification
  - Konjunktiv I formation
  - Konjunktiv II formation
  - Direct to indirect speech conversion
  - Wish expression construction
  - Hypothetical statement creation
  - Polite request formulation
  - Literary subjunctive interpretation
  - Mood selection justification
  - Error correction in subjunctive use
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Regular verb forms in common subjunctive I patterns (er sage, sie habe)
    - Simple direct-to-indirect speech transformations with clear reporting verbs
    - Basic hypothetical statements with würde + infinitive construction
  medium:
    - Irregular verb forms in subjunctive I and II (sein, haben, werden, modal verbs)
    - Converting complex sentences with multiple clauses to indirect speech
    - Distinguishing when to use Konjunktiv I versus Konjunktiv II in reported speech
  hard:
    - Subjunctive forms that are identical to indicative requiring alternate constructions
    - Nested indirect speech with multiple reporting levels
    - Analyzing subtle differences in meaning between indicative and subjunctive mood choices
real_world_context:
  - Reading newspaper articles that use Konjunktiv I to report statements from politicians or witnesses without endorsing their claims
  - Writing formal emails or letters using Konjunktiv II for polite requests (Ich würde gerne wissen...)
  - Understanding literary texts where authors use subjunctive to create distance from characters' thoughts or unreliable narrators
  - Reporting conversations to parents or teachers using indirect speech to relay what others said accurately
  - Expressing wishes or hypothetical scenarios in discussions about future plans or imaginary situations
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing Konjunktiv I and würde-forms within single passages
  - Don't use subjunctive forms beyond Grade 7 scope (Plusquamperfekt Konjunktiv)
  - Avoid archaic or regional subjunctive variants unfamiliar to students
  - Don't present ambiguous identical indicative/subjunctive forms without context
  - Avoid overly complex structures with more than two reporting levels
prerequisites:
  - grade6-grammar-syntax
  - grade5-sentence-elements
  - grade4-parts-of-speech
