**Create a task where {{student_name}} analyzes and creates words using word formation processes.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Composition (Komposition)**: Break down compound words into components or create new compound words
  2. **Compound Word Types**: Distinguish **Determinativkompositum** (determining: Haustür) from other types
  3. **Derivation (Ableitung)**: Identify words formed by adding prefixes or suffixes to word stems
  4. **Prefixes**: Work with common prefixes (*un-, vor-, ver-, ent-, be-, er-, zer-, miss-*)
  5. **Suffixes**: Work with common suffixes (*-ung, -heit, -keit, -schaft, -lich, -ig, -bar, -los*)
  6. **Word Stem Analysis**: Identify the **Wortstamm** (word stem/root) in related words
  7. **Word Families**: Create word families showing related words from the same stem
  8. **Creative Word Formation**: Create new, meaningful compound words following German formation rules

- Provide clear examples of both composition and derivation
- Use age-appropriate, familiar vocabulary
- Show how word formation changes meaning and word type
- Use tables to organize word families or word components
- Include visual breaking down of complex words

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse word examples each time (different topics and word types)
- Vary the formation type focus (composition, derivation, prefixes, suffixes)
- Change the word families and stems
- Provide fresh, engaging vocabulary examples
