**Create a task where {{student_name}} extracts and processes information from a text.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Explicit Information**: Identify directly stated facts, data, or information (W-questions: who, what, when, where, why, how)
  2. **Implicit Information**: Infer information that is suggested but not directly stated (reading between the lines)
  3. **Main vs. Supporting Ideas**: Distinguish between central themes and supporting details or examples
  4. **Information Organization**: Create tables, lists, or mind maps to organize extracted information
  5. **Fact Verification**: Check whether specific claims can be found in the text (true/false with evidence)
  6. **Comparison Task**: Extract specific information from multiple sources and compare them
  7. **Summary Creation**: Extract the most important information and condense it into a brief summary
  8. **Question Answering**: Answer detailed questions that require finding information in different parts of the text

- Use age-appropriate texts (newspaper articles, encyclopedia entries, educational texts)
- Provide a text excerpt of 150-250 words
- Include a mix of explicit and implicit information
- Guide students to use reading strategies (skimming, scanning, close reading)
- Ask for evidence or text references when appropriate

**Important**:
- Ensure fresh, diverse text topics each time (science, history, technology, culture, nature, etc.)
- Vary the text type (informational, explanatory, descriptive)
- Change the extraction focus (facts, implications, structure)
- Use different question formats and organizational methods
