Materialgestütztes Schreiben at Abitur level requires synthesizing multiple source materials while developing an independent, well-reasoned position. Unlike Grade 10 material-based writing which focuses on objective synthesis, this concept emphasizes critical evaluation and argumentative positioning.

Students must work efficiently with diverse materials, identify key arguments and evidence, evaluate source credibility, and integrate perspectives into genre-appropriate texts. The focus is on creating original arguments informed by sources, not merely compiling information. {{#if (eq difficulty "hard")}}Tasks should require students to navigate contradictory sources and develop nuanced positions that acknowledge complexity.{{/if}}
