Generate a task where {{childName}} practices reading longer words and texts more fluently and accurately.

**Focus areas to choose from:**
- Breaking down longer words into syllables
- Reading multi-syllable words
- Reading sentences smoothly
- Self-monitoring and correction
- Building reading speed while maintaining accuracy

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Multi-Syllable Word Practice
Present {{num1}} longer words broken into syllables. The student practices reading them by blending the syllables.

Example words:
| Word | Syllables | Practice |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Schmetterling | Schmet-ter-ling | 3 syllables |
| Schokolade | Scho-ko-la-de | 4 syllables |
| Regenschirm | Re-gen-schirm | 3 syllables |
| Lieblingsbuch | Lieb-lings-buch | 3 syllables |

First read syllable by syllable, then read the whole word smoothly.

### Variation 2: Fluency Building Sentences
Provide {{num1}} sentences of increasing length. The student reads each sentence multiple times to build fluency.

Practice sequence:
1. First reading: Slow and careful
2. Second reading: A bit faster
3. Third reading: Smooth and fluent

Example sentences:
- *Der Schmetterling fliegt über die Blumen.*
- *Am Wochenende gehe ich mit meiner Familie in den Zoo.*
- *Die Kinder spielen fröhlich auf dem Spielplatz im Park.*

### Variation 3: Self-Correction Exercise
Present {{num1}} sentences where the student reads and must identify if they made any mistakes, then correct them.

Include sentences with:
- Tricky word combinations
- Similar-looking words
- Longer compound words

Example: *Der Regenschirm ist blau und groß.* (student might misread *Regenschirm* as two separate words)

### Variation 4: Compound Word Breakdown
Show {{num1}} compound words. The student must identify the two (or more) parts, then read the whole word.

Example compound words:
- *Haustür* = Haus + Tür
- *Schulhof* = Schule + Hof
- *Sonnenschein* = Sonne + Schein
- *Fußball* = Fuß + Ball
- *Geburtstag* = Geburt + Tag

### Variation 5: Speed Reading Challenge
Provide a short text ({{num1}} sentences). The student reads it once slowly for accuracy, then again trying to read faster while still being accurate.

Example text:
*"Lisa hat einen Hund. Der Hund heißt Bello. Bello ist groß und braun. Er spielt gerne im Garten. Lisa und Bello sind gute Freunde."*

Track: First reading time vs. second reading time (improvement in speed)

### Variation 6: Chunking Practice
Present {{num1}} longer sentences. The student practices reading in meaningful chunks (phrases) rather than word-by-word.

Example:
- Word-by-word: *Am / Wochenende / gehe / ich / mit / meiner / Familie / in / den / Zoo.*
- In chunks: *Am Wochenende / gehe ich / mit meiner Familie / in den Zoo.*

Mark the chunks with slashes to guide phrasing.

### Variation 7: Tricky Word Focus
Show {{num1}} words that are commonly misread or confused. The student practices reading them accurately.

Tricky word pairs:
| Similar Words | Pay Attention To |
|---------------|------------------|
| *dann* vs. *denn* | Double letters |
| *Bär* vs. *Bier* | Vowel sounds |
| *fiel* vs. *viel* | Beginning letter |
| *wo* vs. *wer* | Ending |

### Variation 8: Expression Reading
Provide {{num1}} sentences with different emotional contexts. The student reads each with appropriate expression.

Examples:
- *"Hurra, wir haben gewonnen!"* (excited, loud)
- *"Psst, das Baby schläft."* (quiet, soft)
- *"Oh nein, mein Ball ist weg."* (sad, disappointed)
- *"Was machst du da?"* (curious, questioning)

This builds fluency by connecting meaning with reading.
