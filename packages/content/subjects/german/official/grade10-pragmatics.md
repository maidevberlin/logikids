name: Pragmatics
description: Understanding how context shapes meaning in communication through speech acts, implicature, presupposition, and politeness strategies
grade: 10
focus: Context-dependent meaning and communication
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Understand and identify different types of speech acts (assertions, questions, commands, promises)
  - Recognize conversational implicature and what speakers mean beyond literal words
  - Identify presuppositions in statements and how they shape understanding
  - Analyze politeness strategies and their social functions in different contexts
  - Understand how context determines meaning in ambiguous or indirect communication
  - Analyze causes of miscommunication based on pragmatic factors
problem_types:
  - Speech act classification
  - Implicature analysis
  - Presupposition identification
  - Politeness evaluation
  - Context interpretation
  - Miscommunication diagnosis
  - Indirect meaning
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify basic speech acts in straightforward utterances
    - Recognize obvious implied meanings in everyday conversations
    - Identify simple presuppositions in clear statements
  medium:
    - Analyze how context changes the meaning of the same utterance
    - Compare politeness strategies across different social situations
    - Explain why indirect communication is used in specific contexts
  hard:
    - Analyze complex cases where multiple pragmatic factors interact
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of communication strategies for specific goals
    - Diagnose subtle miscommunication based on pragmatic mismatches
real_world_context:
  - A job applicant uses indirect language in an interview to appear professional
  - Friends understand each other's sarcasm because they share context and history
  - A teacher uses different politeness levels when speaking to students versus colleagues
  - A politician makes a statement that technically denies wrongdoing but implies guilt
  - Roommates have a conflict because one person's request was too indirect to be understood
  - A customer service representative navigates complaints using careful politeness strategies
  - Text messages are misunderstood because tone and context are missing
  - A teenager asks "Can you pass the salt?" meaning "Please pass the salt" not asking about ability
  - Cultural differences cause confusion when directness is valued differently
  - A witness in court must be careful about presuppositions when answering questions
  - An advertisement implies benefits without making explicit false claims
  - Diplomatic language carefully avoids direct criticism while conveying displeasure
  - A passive-aggressive note on a shared refrigerator creates tension
  - Stage directions in a play indicate how an actor should deliver a line to convey subtext
  - Online forum users misinterpret intent because they lack conversational context
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid examples requiring specialized knowledge of linguistic terminology
  - Do not use culturally specific contexts unfamiliar to German 15-year-olds
  - Avoid ambiguous scenarios where multiple interpretations are equally valid
  - Do not conflate pragmatics with grammar or vocabulary meanings
  - Avoid examples where the pragmatic effect depends on untranslatable wordplay
