   - Table columns: **Introduction** | **Building Tension** | **Climax** | **Conclusion**
   - Include guiding questions for each part

2. **Identifying the Climax**

   - Students identify which sentence is the climax
   - Explain why this is the most exciting moment
   - Discuss how the story builds toward this point

3. **Building Suspense**
   - Give a story beginning and ending
   - Students write the middle part that builds tension to a climax
   - Beginning: "Max fand eine alte Karte im Keller."
   - Ending: "Endlich hatte er den Schatz gefunden!"

4. **Climax Word Bank**
   - Provide exciting words and phrases for creating climax
   - Examples: *plötzlich, unerwartet, in diesem Moment, endlich, überraschend*
   - Students write a short story (8-10 sentences) using at least 4 climax words
   - Circle the climax sentence

5. **Story from Picture Sequence**
   - Describe 4 pictures showing a story sequence
   - Pictures show: calm beginning → tension building → exciting climax → peaceful ending

7. **Emotion Journey**
   - Create a story showing emotion progression

   - Climax occurs at peak emotion (scared)

8. **Rewriting Flat Stories**
   - Present a story without much tension or climax
   - Students rewrite it adding suspense and a clear climax
