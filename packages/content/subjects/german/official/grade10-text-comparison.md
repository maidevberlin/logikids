grade: 10
focus: Comparative literary analysis

  - Motif tracking
  - Perspective comparison
  - Author comparison

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:

    - Focus on one clear aspect (theme, character, or setting)
    - Identify 2-3 obvious similarities or differences
  medium:
    - Compare texts from different genres or different epochs
    - Analyze multiple aspects (theme, style, structure) in relationship
    - Develop a coherent comparative argument with 4-5 points
  hard:
    - Compare texts across genres and epochs with complex relationships
    - Synthesize comparison into original insights about literary development
    - Address subtle connections and contradictions between texts
real_world_context:
  - Comparing a Romantic poem with a modern song about nature to see how perspectives on the environment evolved

  - Don't list similarities without analytical insight into their significance
  - Avoid comparing texts with no meaningful connection or shared element
  - Don't treat comparison as two separate analyses without synthesis
  - Avoid vague comparative language like "similar" without specifics
  - Don't ignore historical and generic context that shapes the texts
