# Fluent Silent Reading

Create a task where {{name}} develops silent reading skills appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Speed and Comprehension Balance
Practice reading silently while maintaining understanding:

**Steps:**
1. Choose a text (150-200 words)
2. Time yourself reading it silently
3. Answer 5 comprehension questions:
   - Who were the main characters?
   - Where did it take place?
   - What was the main event?
   - Why did it happen?
   - How did it end?
4. Read the same text again, try to read faster
5. Answer the questions again
6. Goal: Faster reading WITHOUT losing comprehension

## Variation 2: Silent Reading Technique Check
Practice proper silent reading habits:

**Self-check while reading:**
- ☐ Am I moving my lips? (try to stop)
- ☐ Am I pointing with my finger? (try to use only your eyes)
- ☐ Am I whispering? (read completely silently)
- ☐ Are my eyes moving smoothly across lines?
- ☐ Am I understanding what I read?

Read a paragraph. Check yourself. Try to improve one habit at a time.

## Variation 3: Timed Reading Progress
Track reading speed improvement over time:

**Week 1:**
- Read a 200-word passage silently
- Time: ___ minutes ___ seconds
- Comprehension check: ___/5 correct

**Week 2:**
- Read a similar 200-word passage
- Time: ___ minutes ___ seconds
- Comprehension check: ___/5 correct

Goal: Maintain or improve comprehension while reading faster.

## Variation 4: Word Recognition Automaticity
Practice recognizing words instantly without sounding them out:

**Common word flash practice:**
Read these word lists silently as fast as possible while understanding them:

*und, der, die, das, mit, für, nicht, auch, aber, wenn, oder, können, müssen, sollen*

Goal: Recognize instantly without "reading" letter by letter.

**Challenge:** Time how long it takes to read 50 common words silently.

## Variation 5: Silent Reading Stamina
Build endurance for longer silent reading periods:

**Week 1:** Read silently for 10 minutes without stopping
**Week 2:** Read silently for 15 minutes
**Week 3:** Read silently for 20 minutes
**Week 4:** Read silently for 25 minutes

After each session:
- How many pages did you read?
- Did you stay focused?
- What did you learn or enjoy?

## Variation 6: Comprehension Monitoring
Practice checking your own understanding while reading:

**Stop and Think strategy:**
Read a paragraph silently, then ask yourself:
- What just happened?
- Do I understand this?
- Can I picture it in my mind?
- Should I reread something?

If you can't answer, **reread** the confusing part.

Practice with 5-6 paragraphs, stopping after each to check understanding.

## Variation 7: Silent Reading vs Reading Aloud
Compare the two reading modes:

| Aspect | Silent Reading | Reading Aloud |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Purpose | Understanding for yourself | Sharing with others |
| Concentration | Internal focus | External performance |
| When to use | Studying, personal reading | Presentations, sharing stories |

Practice the same text both ways and notice the differences.

## Variation 8: Summary After Silent Reading
Read a longer text (2-3 pages) silently, then write a summary:

**Summary structure:**
- **Main characters:** Who is the text about?
- **Setting:** Where and when?
- **Main events:** What happened? (3-5 sentences)
- **Conclusion:** How did it end?
- **Opinion:** What did you think?

This proves you understood what you read silently.

**Remember:**
- Good silent readers don't move their lips
- They read in phrases, not word by word
- They understand while reading, not after
- They can read for longer periods
- They adjust speed based on difficulty
