version_notes: Initial concept for Grade 9 text-based argumentative essay (textgebundene Erörterung)
---

The textgebundene Erörterung requires students to engage critically with a source text by analyzing its arguments and rhetorical strategies, then developing and defending their own position in dialogue with the source. This differs from freie Erörterung by anchoring the discussion in close reading and text analysis.

Students should demonstrate understanding of the source text's structure and persuasive techniques while maintaining their own analytical voice. The response should integrate textual evidence with independent reasoning.
