name: Syntax - Main and Subordinate Clauses
description: Language Reflection
grade: 5
ages:
  - 10
  - 11
focus: Language Reflection
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Distinguish sentence types reliably
  - 'Identify subordinate clause types (temporal, causal, conditional)'
  - Understand sentence structure
  - Use correct punctuation
prerequisites:
  - grade-4-sentence-types
example_tasks:
  - Identify main clauses and subordinate clauses in complex sentences
  - Determine the type of subordinate clause (temporal, causal, conditional, etc.)
  - Combine simple sentences into complex sentences using subordinate clauses
real_world_context: Understanding sentence structure helps students write more sophisticated, nuanced sentences. Subordinate clauses allow for expressing complex relationships (cause-effect, time sequences, conditions) that are essential in academic writing, argumentation, and clear communication. This grammatical knowledge supports both writing and reading comprehension.

**Create a task where {{student_name}} works with main clauses (**Hauptsätze**) and subordinate clauses (**Nebensätze**).**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Clause Identification**: Identify and mark **Hauptsatz** (main clause) and **Nebensatz** (subordinate clause) in complex sentences
  2. **Subordinate Clause Types**: Identify the type: **Temporalsatz** (when/als/während), **Kausalsatz** (weil/da), **Konditionalsatz** (wenn/falls), **Relativsatz** (der/die/das)
  3. **Conjunction Recognition**: Identify subordinating conjunctions (*weil, dass, obwohl, wenn, als, während, damit, etc.*)
  4. **Verb Position**: Explain how verb position changes in subordinate clauses (verb moves to end)
  5. **Comma Rules**: Practice placing commas correctly between main and subordinate clauses
  6. **Sentence Combining**: Combine simple sentences into complex sentences using subordinate clauses
  7. **Subordinate Clause Function**: Explain what information the subordinate clause adds (time, reason, condition, etc.)
  8. **Sentence Analysis**: Diagram or analyze the structure of complex sentences

- Provide clear examples of different clause types
- Use age-appropriate sentence content (everyday situations, stories, explanations)
- Show verb position differences (main clause vs. subordinate clause)
- Use tables to organize clause types and their conjunctions
- Include comma placement practice

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse sentence content each time (different topics and situations)
- Vary the clause type focus (temporal, causal, conditional, relative)
- Change the complexity level (simple to complex sentences)
- Provide fresh, engaging sentence examples
