Your task should:

  2. **Extended Infinitives**: Identify when commas are required vs. optional with longer infinitive constructions
  3. **Appositions**: Use commas to set off **Appositionen** (additional explanations: *Mein Freund, ein begabter Musiker, spielt Klavier.*)
  4. **Participial Phrases**: Place commas with participle constructions (*Lachend kam sie ins Zimmer.*)
  5. **Comma Combinations**: Apply multiple comma rules in complex sentences
  6. **Optional vs. Required**: Distinguish when commas are mandatory vs. optional
  7. **Error Correction**: Find and correct comma errors in example texts
  8. **Complete Mastery**: Practice all comma rules together (subordinate clauses, infinitives, appositions, enumerations)

- Provide clear example sentences showing different comma rules
- Use age-appropriate content (school, family, hobbies, everyday situations)
- Explain the rules with examples
- Show both correct and incorrect comma placement
- Use tables to organize different comma rules

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse sentence content each time (different topics and structures)
- Vary the rule focus (infinitives, appositions, participles, combinations)
- Change the complexity level (single rule to multiple rules)
- Provide fresh, engaging sentence examples
