id: grade5-word-classes
name: Word Classes and Morphology
description: All Wortarten, word formation, prefixes, suffixes
grade: 5
focus: Comprehensive mastery of word classes and word formation processes
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and correctly use all major word classes including verbs, nouns, adjectives, articles, adverbs, numerals, pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions
  - Analyze word structure by identifying stems, prefixes, and suffixes in German words
  - Apply knowledge of derivation (Ableitung) to create new words using prefixes and suffixes
  - Construct and deconstruct compound words (Zusammensetzung) to understand meaning formation
  - Recognize and organize words into word families (Wortfamilien) based on shared stems
  - Distinguish between synonyms, antonyms, and homonyms to expand vocabulary precision
  - Apply morphological knowledge to decode unfamiliar words and expand vocabulary systematically
problem_types:
  - Word class identification
  - Stem and affix analysis
  - Derivation construction
  - Compound word building
  - Word family grouping
  - Inflection application
  - Synonym and antonym matching
  - Semantic field organization
  - Morphological transformation
  - Vocabulary expansion task
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify word classes in simple sentences with clear context
    - Recognize common prefixes (un-, ver-, be-) and suffixes (-ung, -heit, -lich)
    - Build simple two-part compound words with transparent meanings
  medium:
    - Apply multiple affixes to stems to create complex derivations
    - Analyze three-part compounds and explain meaning relationships
    - Organize words into semantic fields and word families with 5-8 members
  hard:
    - Identify word class shifts through derivation (verb to noun, adjective to adverb)
    - Analyze complex morphological relationships across multiple word families
    - Apply inflection patterns including all four cases, comparison forms, and verb conjugations
prerequisites:
  - grade4-parts-of-speech
  - grade4-word-formation
real_world_context:
  - Understanding word formation helps decode complex vocabulary in newspaper articles, textbooks, and online content without needing a dictionary
  - Recognizing prefixes and suffixes allows students to understand scientific and technical terms across school subjects
  - Knowledge of compound words helps navigate German's characteristic long words in official documents, instructions, and informational texts
  - Organizing vocabulary by semantic fields improves writing precision when describing experiences, objects, or concepts in essays and presentations
  - Understanding word families accelerates vocabulary learning in German and provides strategies for learning other languages
  - Analyzing word structure to understand new vocabulary in fantasy novels or science fiction stories
  - Using derivation knowledge to create expressive adjectives and adverbs in creative writing
  - Recognizing root words when encountering unfamiliar terms in history or geography textbooks
  - Building compound words to precisely describe inventions or imaginary creatures in storytelling
  - Identifying word classes to improve grammar accuracy when learning foreign languages
  - Using semantic fields to organize vocabulary study for tests or expand descriptive writing
  - Applying morphological analysis to decode technical instructions for games, crafts, or experiments
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid word class examples with ambiguous function without clear context
  - Don't use regional dialects or archaic word forms in morphology tasks
  - Avoid compound words longer than three components for Grade 5 students
  - Don't introduce Latin or Greek word roots without German derivation context
  - Avoid semantic fields mixing abstract concepts beyond 10-11 year old experience
