**Create a task where {{student_name}} states an opinion and supports it with reasons.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Basic Opinion Statement**: State a clear thesis/opinion on a topic and provide 2-3 supporting arguments
  2. **Argument-Example Structure**: Practice the **These-Argument-Beispiel** (thesis-argument-example) pattern
  3. **Multiple Arguments**: Develop three different arguments supporting one position
  4. **Example Support**: Support each argument with specific, concrete examples
  5. **Argument Evaluation**: Analyze which arguments are strong or weak and explain why
  6. **Opinion Analysis**: Read an opinion text and identify the thesis and supporting arguments
  7. **Structured Writing**: Write a complete opinion piece with introduction, arguments, and conclusion
  8. **Connecting Words**: Use appropriate connectors (*erstens, zweitens, außerdem, deshalb, zum Beispiel*)

- Use age-appropriate topics (school life, free time, technology, environment, animals, sports)
- Present clear, debatable thesis statements
- Show good argument structure with reasons and examples
- Use persuasive language appropriately
- Include organizational markers and connectors

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse opinion topics each time (school, environment, technology, social, personal)
- Vary the complexity (2-3 arguments vs. deeper analysis)
- Change the specific issues and contexts
- Provide fresh, engaging debate topics relevant to 10-11 year olds
