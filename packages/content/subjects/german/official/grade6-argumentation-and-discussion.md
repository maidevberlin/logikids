**Create a task where {{student_name}} develops and presents structured arguments.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Full Argumentative Essay**: Write a complete **Erörterung** with **Einleitung** (introduction), **Hauptteil** (arguments), **Schluss** (conclusion)
  2. **Pro and Con Structure**: Present arguments for both sides (**Pro-Kontra-Erörterung**) before taking a position
  3. **Linear Argumentation**: Build arguments that progressively support one position (**lineare Erörterung**)
  4. **Counter-Arguments**: Anticipate opposing views and refute them effectively
  5. **Argument Strength**: Evaluate which arguments are strong or weak and explain why
  6. **Persuasive Techniques**: Use rhetorical devices and persuasive language effectively
  7. **Connecting Arguments**: Use appropriate connectors (*einerseits...andererseits, zwar...aber, außerdem, jedoch, folglich*)
  8. **Argument Analysis**: Analyze an argumentative text for structure, arguments, and effectiveness

- Use age-appropriate debate topics (school uniforms, homework, technology use, environmental issues, animal welfare, sports)
- Show clear argumentative structure
- Include both pro and con perspectives
- Use tables to organize arguments
- Provide examples of strong vs. weak arguments

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse argumentation topics each time (school, society, environment, technology, personal)
- Vary the structural approach (linear, pro-con, dialectical)
- Change the complexity level (simple to sophisticated arguments)
- Provide fresh, engaging debate topics relevant to 11-12 year olds
