  - letter-and-sound-learning
example_tasks:
  - 'Listen to the word "Sonne" - how many sounds do you hear?'
  - Write the word as you hear it (phonetic spelling)
  - 'Segment the word "Mama" into individual sounds: M-a-m-a'

Generate a task where {{childName}} practices hearing sounds in words and writing them down phonetically.

**Focus areas to choose from:**
- Counting sounds in words
- Segmenting words into individual sounds
- Writing words as they sound
- Identifying beginning, middle, and ending sounds
- Understanding sound-letter correspondence

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Sound Counting
Present {{num1}} simple words. For each word, the student must count how many sounds they hear.

Example words:
| Word | Number of Sounds |
|------|------------------|
| *Oma* | 3 (O-m-a) |
| *Ball* | 3 (B-a-ll) |
| *Haus* | 4 (H-au-s) |
| *Mama* | 4 (M-a-m-a) |
| *Sonne* | 4 (S-o-nn-e) |

### Variation 2: Sound Boxes (Elkonin Boxes)
Draw boxes for each sound in a word. The student listens to the word and writes one letter (or letter combination) in each box.

Example:
- Word: *Bus*
  - Boxes: [ B ] [ u ] [ s ]
- Word: *Oma*
  - Boxes: [ O ] [ m ] [ a ]

Provide {{num1}} words with the correct number of boxes drawn.

### Variation 3: Phonetic Writing Practice
Say {{num1}} simple words aloud. The student writes each word as they hear it (phonetic spelling is acceptable and encouraged).

Example words:
- *Maus* → student might write "Maus" or "Mauß"
- *Sonne* → student might write "Sonne" or "Sone"
- *Ball* → student should write "Ball"

Focus on hearing all sounds, not perfect spelling.

### Variation 4: Beginning Sound Match
Present {{num1}} pictures of objects. The student must write the letter for the **beginning sound** of each word.

Example:
- Picture of *Apfel* → A
- Picture of *Ball* → B
- Picture of *Sonne* → S
- Picture of *Tisch* → T

### Variation 5: Sound Segmentation Exercise
Provide {{num1}} words. The student must say each word slowly, segmenting it into individual sounds.

Example:
- *Mama* → /m/ /a/ /m/ /a/
- *Ball* → /b/ /a/ /ll/
- *Haus* → /h/ /au/ /s/

Then write the word using letters for each sound.

### Variation 6: Missing Sound Detective
Show words with one sound missing (represented by a line). The student must identify and write the missing sound.

Examples:
- *M_ma* → a
- *Ba__* → ll
- *_onne* → S
- *Ha_s* → u

### Variation 7: Sound Position Identification
Say {{num1}} words and a target sound. The student identifies where the sound appears: **Anfang** (beginning), **Mitte** (middle), or **Ende** (end).

Example:
- Word: *Maus*, Sound: /m/ → Anfang
- Word: *Oma*, Sound: /m/ → Mitte
- Word: *Ball*, Sound: /a/ → Mitte
- Word: *Bus*, Sound: /s/ → Ende

### Variation 8: Build-a-Word Challenge
Provide {{num1}} sets of individual sounds (written or spoken). The student must blend the sounds together and write the complete word.

Examples:
- /M/ /a/ /m/ /a/ → *Mama*
- /B/ /a/ /ll/ → *Ball*
- /S/ /o/ /nn/ /e/ → *Sonne*
- /O/ /m/ /a/ → *Oma*
