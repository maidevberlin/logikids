Generate a task where {{childName}} practices recognizing letters and connecting them with their sounds.

**Focus areas to choose from:**
- Identifying initial sounds in words
- Matching letters to sounds
- Reading simple syllables
- Distinguishing vowels from consonants
- Recognizing letter shapes and names

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Initial Sound Identification
Present {{num1}} pictures of common objects (like *Apfel*, *Ball*, *Haus*, *Sonne*). Ask which letter each word begins with. Include both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Example objects to choose from:
| Letter | Word Examples |
|--------|--------------|
| A | Apfel, Auto, Auge |
| B | Ball, Baum, Brot |
| M | Maus, Mond, Mama |
| S | Sonne, Schiff, Stuhl |
| T | Tisch, Tasse, Tiger |

### Variation 2: Syllable Reading Practice
Create a table with {{num1}} rows showing different syllable families. Have the student read each syllable aloud.

Example syllable patterns:
- *ma, me, mi, mo, mu*
- *la, le, li, lo, lu*
- *sa, se, si, so, su*
- *ta, te, ti, to, tu*

### Variation 3: Sound Matching Game
Show {{num1}} letters and provide {{num2}} words. The student must match each word to its beginning letter. Use a mix of similar-sounding letters (like B/P, D/T, G/K).

### Variation 4: Vowel vs Consonant Sorting
Present {{num1}} letters in random order. Ask the student to sort them into two groups: **Vokale** (vowels: A, E, I, O, U) and **Konsonanten** (consonants).

Example: *M, A, S, E, T, I, B, O, L, U*

### Variation 5: Letter Writing Practice
Show pictures of {{num1}} objects. For each object, the student must:
1. Say the word aloud
2. Identify the first sound
3. Write the corresponding letter (both uppercase and lowercase)

### Variation 6: Sound Position Detective
Present {{num1}} simple words where the student must identify if a specific sound appears at the **beginning**, **middle**, or **end** of the word.

Example: Where do you hear the sound "a" in these words?
- *Ball* (middle)
- *Apfel* (beginning)
- *Mama* (middle and end)

### Variation 7: Missing Letter Puzzle
Show pictures with incomplete words where one letter is missing. The student must fill in the correct letter based on the sound they hear.

Example:
- *_all* (Ball)
- *Son_e* (Sonne)
- *_aus* (Haus or Maus)

### Variation 8: Letter Hunt
Provide a short list of {{num1}} simple words. Ask the student to circle or highlight all instances of a specific letter (e.g., "Find all the letter *M*s").

Example text: *Mama mag Milch. Mia malt ein Bild.*
