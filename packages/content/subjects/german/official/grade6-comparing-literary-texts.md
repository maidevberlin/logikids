**Create a task where {{student_name}} compares two or more literary texts.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Theme Comparison**: Compare how different texts handle the same theme (friendship, courage, justice, growing up)
  2. **Genre Comparison**: Compare texts from different genres (poem vs. story, novel vs. short story)
  3. **Version Comparison**: Compare different versions of the same story (traditional vs. modern, different authors)
  4. **Style Comparison**: Compare writing styles, narrative techniques, or language use
  5. **Character Comparison**: Compare similar characters from different texts
  6. **Structure Comparison**: Compare how different texts are structured or organized
  7. **Motif Comparison**: Compare how recurring motifs or symbols are used in different texts
  8. **Perspective Comparison**: Compare how different narrative perspectives affect similar stories

- Provide excerpts from both texts (150-250 words each) or detailed summaries
- Use age-appropriate literary texts (poems, stories, fables, novels)
- Focus on accessible themes and content
- Use tables or Venn diagrams to organize comparisons
- Encourage use of specific examples and quotations

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse text pairings each time (different genres, themes, styles)
- Vary the comparison focus (theme, structure, style, character)
- Change the specific texts and literary examples
- Provide fresh, engaging comparison tasks
