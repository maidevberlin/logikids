difficulty_guidelines:

    - Simple feedback forms with 3-5 checkable criteria
    - Clear coherence issues (missing transitions, repeated information)
  medium:
    - Multi-paragraph texts requiring multiple revision aspects simultaneously
    - Constructive peer feedback writing with specific improvement suggestions
    - Balancing clarity, audience appropriateness, and text type conventions
  hard:
    - Extended texts needing subtle style refinement and nuanced improvements
    - Complex writing conferences addressing multiple competing revision priorities
    - Advanced audience adaptation and genre-specific revision strategies
prerequisites:

real_world_context:
  - Students conduct peer review sessions before submitting essays or reports for grading

  - Avoid unrealistic peer feedback scenarios with hostile or unhelpful responses
  - Don't mix too many unrelated revision criteria in a single task
  - Avoid texts where revision priorities are unclear or contradictory
