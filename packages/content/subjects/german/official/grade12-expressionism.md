Expressionism represents a radical break with traditional aesthetics, emphasizing subjective experience, psychological intensity, and formal experimentation. The movement emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the alienation of modern urban life, the crisis of values, and ultimately the catastrophe of World War I.

Key to understanding Expressionist literature is recognizing how formal innovation serves thematic purposes: fragmented syntax mirrors fragmented consciousness, violent imagery reflects inner turmoil projected onto the external world, and the collapse of traditional poetic forms embodies the collapse of traditional certainties. The Expressionist "Schrei" (scream) is both a formal technique and an existential gesture.
