# Using Dictionary

Create a task where {{name}} develops dictionary skills appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Alphabetical Order Practice
Master the foundation of dictionary use - alphabetical order:

**Level 1 - First letter:**
Sort these words: *Apfel, Baum, Katze, Hund, Lampe*
Answer: *Apfel, Baum, Hund, Katze, Lampe*

**Level 2 - Second letter:**
Sort these words: *Apfel, Auto, Affe, Arm, Auge*
Answer: *Affe, Apfel, Arm, Auge, Auto*

**Level 3 - Third letter:**
Sort these words: *Apfel, Aprikose, April*
Answer: *Apfel, April, Aprikose*

**Challenge:** Sort 15-20 words into perfect alphabetical order.

## Variation 2: Using Guide Words
Learn to use guide words at the top of dictionary pages:

**Guide words example:** *Hase - Haus*

Which words would be on this page?
- ✓ *Hasel* (comes between Hase and Haus)
- ✗ *Hut* (comes after Haus)
- ✓ *Hast* (comes between Hase and Haus)
- ✗ *Hand* (comes before Hase)

Practice: Given guide words, decide which words belong on that page.

## Variation 3: Finding Word Meanings
Practice looking up words and understanding definitions:

**Steps to look up a word:**
1. Think about the first letter
2. Open the dictionary to that section
3. Use guide words to find the right page
4. Scan down to find your word
5. Read the definition
6. Write the meaning in your own words

**Example:**
- Word: *neugierig*
- Dictionary definition: "wanting to know about things; curious"
- Your own words: "when you want to find out about something"

Look up 5 unknown words and explain their meanings.

## Variation 4: Checking Spelling
Use the dictionary as a spelling checker:

**When unsure of spelling:**
1. Try to guess how the word starts
2. Look it up by that letter
3. Check different possible spellings
4. Find the correct version

**Common spelling challenges:**
- Words with *ie* or *ei*: *Wiese* or *Weise*?
- Words with double consonants: *kommen* or *komen*?
- Verbs vs nouns: *laufen* vs *Laufen*

Practice: Here are 10 misspelled words. Find the correct spelling in the dictionary.

## Variation 5: Finding Article (Gender) Information
Learn to use the dictionary to find noun genders:

**Dictionary shows:**
- *Hund, der* → masculine, use "der"
- *Katze, die* → feminine, use "die"
- *Haus, das* → neuter, use "das"

**Task:**
Look up these nouns and write the correct article:
- ___ Baum → der Baum
- ___ Blume → die Blume
- ___ Buch → das Buch

Practice with 10 nouns you're uncertain about.

## Variation 6: Understanding Entry Information
Learn what different parts of a dictionary entry mean:

**Sample entry:**
*laufen* (Verb): to run, to walk
- Past tense: *lief*
- Perfect tense: *gelaufen*
Example: *Ich laufe jeden Tag.*

**Information includes:**
- **Word** (main entry)
- **Word type** (noun, verb, adjective)
- **Meaning** (definition)
- **Grammar forms** (plurals, verb forms)
- **Example sentence**

Find an entry and identify all these parts.

## Variation 7: Dictionary Speed Challenge
Build fluency in dictionary use:

**Week 1:** Time how long it takes to find 5 words
**Week 2:** Try to find the same 5 words faster
**Week 3:** Find 5 new words - aim for the same time
**Week 4:** Can you find 10 words in the time it took for 5?

**Tips to speed up:**
- Know the alphabet very well
- Use guide words efficiently
- Estimate which part of the dictionary to open to

## Variation 8: Independent Word Learning
Use the dictionary for self-directed learning:

**When reading and you find an unknown word:**

1. **Try context first:** Can you guess from the sentence?
2. **Look it up:** Find it in the dictionary
3. **Read the definition:** Make sure you understand
4. **Write it down:** Word + meaning
5. **Use it:** Create your own sentence
6. **Review:** Check your new words weekly

**Example learning log:**

| New Word | Meaning | My Sentence |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| *mutig* | brave | Der mutige Ritter kämpfte gegen den Drachen. |
| *plötzlich* | suddenly | Plötzlich begann es zu regnen. |

Keep a vocabulary notebook with new words you learn from the dictionary.

**Remember - Dictionary Skills:**
- Know your alphabet perfectly
- Use guide words to save time
- Read the whole entry, not just first meaning
- Check word type (noun, verb, adjective)
- For German nouns, always note the article
- Practice regularly to get faster
- Use what you learn in your writing
