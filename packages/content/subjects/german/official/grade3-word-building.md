id: grade3-word-building
name: Word Building and Morphology
description: Understand stems, prefixes, suffixes; create word families; recognize compound nouns; explore vowel shifts in word families
grade: 3
focus: Morphological awareness and word formation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and extract word stems from complex words and understand their core meaning
  - Recognize and apply common prefixes to modify word meaning
  - Recognize and apply common suffixes to change word class and meaning
  - Create and analyze word families by identifying related words with the same stem
  - Recognize vowel shifts in word families and understand how they signal meaning changes
  - Form compound nouns and understand how articles determine the gender of compounds
  - Apply morphological knowledge to decode unfamiliar words and improve spelling
problem_types:
  - Stem extraction
  - Prefix identification
  - Suffix application
  - Word family creation
  - Vowel shift recognition
  - Compound noun formation
  - Article assignment
  - Morphological decomposition
  - Word class transformation
  - Stem-based spelling
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Two-part compound nouns with familiar base words
    - Common prefixes like "un-" or suffixes like "-chen"
    - Word families with consistent vowel patterns
  medium:
    - Three-part compound nouns with clear semantic relationships
    - Multiple prefixes or suffixes on one stem
    - Word families showing simple vowel shifts like "a" to "ä"
  hard:
    - Complex derivations with multiple morphological changes
    - Word families with irregular vowel shifts across multiple forms
    - Compound nouns with linking elements or morphological adjustments
prerequisites:
  - grade1-spelling
  - grade2-syllables-and-word-structure
  - grade2-compound-words
real_world_context:
  - Students decode unfamiliar words in science texts by identifying familiar stems and affixes
  - Children expand their vocabulary by learning how prefixes and suffixes create new words
  - Understanding word families helps students recognize spelling patterns and avoid common errors
  - Analyzing compound nouns helps students determine the correct article in German grammar
  - Morphological awareness supports dictionary use by helping students find base word entries
  - Creating compound nouns to name new fantasy creatures like "Feuerdrache" (fire-dragon)
  - Recognizing that "un-" changes meaning to opposite in words like "glücklich" vs "unglücklich"
  - Understanding that adding "-chen" makes things smaller like "Hund" becomes "Hündchen"
  - Building word families from "laufen" to understand "Läufer", "verlaufen", "Lauf"
  - Determining the article "die" for "Haustür" by identifying "Tür" as the main noun
  - Using prefix knowledge to guess meanings of unfamiliar words in adventure stories
  - Recognizing vowel shifts in word pairs like "Vater" and "Väter" for plural forms
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid word stems shorter than two letters or longer than single syllables
  - Do not use rare or archaic prefixes/suffixes beyond grade 3 vocabulary
  - Avoid compound nouns with more than three components
  - Do not include Latin or Greek stems unfamiliar to 8-9 year olds
  - Avoid word families with highly irregular or unpredictable vowel shifts
