# Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives

Create a task where {{name}} practices identifying and using word types appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Word Type Sorting
Provide a mixed list of 12-15 words and have the student sort them:

| **Nouns** (Nomen) | **Verbs** (Verben) | **Adjectives** (Adjektive) |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Things, people, animals | Action words | Describing words |
| | | |

Example words: *Hund, rennen, groß, Schule, lesen, klein, Baum, springen, lustig, Mutter, schreiben, schön*

**Remember:** Nouns are capitalized in German!

## Variation 2: Article Matching
Give nouns without articles and have the student add the correct article:

- ___ Katze (die)
- ___ Haus (das)
- ___ Baum (der)
- ___ Schule (die)
- ___ Auto (das)

Then sort by article:
- **der** (masculine)
- **die** (feminine)
- **das** (neuter)

## Variation 3: Verb Action Game
Present verbs and have the student:
- Identify them as action words
- Demonstrate or explain the action
- Use each verb in a sentence
- Find the verb in the sentence (underline it)

Example verbs: *laufen, essen, schlafen, spielen, lachen, malen, singen*

## Variation 4: Adjective Enhancement
Give simple sentences with basic adjectives and ask students to replace them:

**Original:** Der Hund ist *klein*.
**Enhanced:** Der Hund ist *winzig* / *niedlich* / *zierlich*.

**Original:** Das Haus ist *groß*.
**Enhanced:** Das Haus ist *riesig* / *prächtig* / *gewaltig*.

Teach that adjectives make sentences more interesting and precise.

## Variation 5: Sentence Building Game
Provide word cards and have the student build sentences using all three word types:

**Pattern:** Article + Adjective + Noun + Verb

Examples:
- *Die kleine Katze springt.*
- *Der große Hund rennt.*
- *Das rote Auto fährt.*

Color-code the word types:
- **Nouns**: blue
- **Verbs**: red
- **Adjectives**: green

## Variation 6: Text Analysis
Give a short text (3-4 sentences) and have the student:

1. Find all **nouns** and circle them
2. Find all **verbs** and underline them
3. Find all **adjectives** and put a box around them
4. Count each type:
   - ___ nouns
   - ___ verbs
   - ___ adjectives

## Variation 7: Word Type Questions
Create a question game where students identify word types:

- What kind of word is *Schule*? (noun - it's a thing/place)
- What kind of word is *schnell*? (adjective - it describes)
- What kind of word is *lesen*? (verb - it's an action)
- Which word is the noun: *grün, Gras, wachsen*? (Gras)
- Which word is the verb: *Tisch, alt, stehen*? (stehen)

## Variation 8: Create Your Own Sentence
Guide the student to write original sentences using specific word types:

**Task 1:** Write a sentence with 1 noun, 1 verb, 1 adjective
**Example:** *Der schnelle Hase rennt.*

**Task 2:** Write a sentence with 2 nouns, 1 verb
**Example:** *Die Katze jagt die Maus.*

**Task 3:** Write a sentence with 1 noun, 1 verb, 2 adjectives
**Example:** *Das kleine, blaue Auto fährt.*

Check that:
- Nouns are capitalized
- Articles match the noun
- Sentences make sense
