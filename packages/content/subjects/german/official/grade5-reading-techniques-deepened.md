  - Intensive reading (detailed understanding)
  - Navigate complex texts
prerequisites:
  - grade-4-reading-different-text-types
example_tasks:
  - Use skimming to quickly determine what a text is about without reading every word
  - Use scanning to find specific information (dates, names, numbers) in a longer text
  - Apply intensive reading to understand complex passages in detail
real_world_context: Different reading situations require different techniques. Students need to skim news websites for interesting articles, scan reference books for specific facts, and read instructions or study materials intensively.

**Create a task where {{student_name}} practices and applies different reading techniques strategically.**

Your task should:
- Focus on one of these variations:
  1. **Skimming Practice**: Read quickly to get the general idea/main topic without reading every word (headlines, first sentences, keywords)
  2. **Scanning Practice**: Search for specific information (names, dates, numbers, facts) by quickly scanning the text
  3. **Intensive Reading**: Read carefully and thoroughly to understand all details and nuances
  4. **Technique Selection**: Decide which reading technique is best for a given purpose
  5. **Preview Reading**: Use headings, subheadings, pictures, and text structure to predict content before reading
  6. **Reading Speed**: Practice adjusting reading speed based on text difficulty and purpose
  7. **Strategic Reading**: Combine techniques (skim first, then scan, then read intensively) for efficient comprehension
  8. **Note-Taking**: Practice taking notes while reading using different techniques (highlighting, underlining, marginal notes)

- Provide texts of different types and lengths (200-400 words)
- Use clear, age-appropriate content (informational texts, instructions, articles, stories)
- Create specific reading purposes or questions
- Show how different techniques serve different goals
- Use tables to compare techniques or organize findings

**Important**:
- Ensure diverse text topics each time (science, history, nature, technology, culture)
- Vary the reading technique focus (skimming, scanning, intensive, combined)
- Change the reading purpose and context
- Provide fresh, engaging texts for practice
