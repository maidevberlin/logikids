name: Complex Sentence Structures
description: Conditional, consequential, concessive, and adversative clauses; constructing and analyzing compound-complex sentences
grade: 7
focus: Advanced clause types and multi-level sentence construction
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and correctly use conditional clauses with wenn, falls, sofern to express hypothetical situations
  - Construct consequential clauses with so dass, dass, sodass to show results and effects
  - Apply concessive clauses with obwohl, obgleich, wenngleich to express contrast and unexpected outcomes
  - Use adversative clauses with während, wohingegen, dagegen to show opposition or simultaneous contrast
  - Differentiate simple, compound, and complex sentences from compound-complex structures with multiple subordination levels
  - Recognize how sentence complexity and clause relationships affect communicative effect and style
  - Combine multiple subordinate clauses with appropriate conjunctions to create sophisticated argumentation
problem_types:
  - Conditional clause construction
  - Consequential relationship identification
  - Concessive clause application
  - Adversative clause usage
  - Conjunction selection
  - Clause type classification
  - Sentence structure analysis
  - Multi-level subordination
  - Clause combination
  - Communicative effect evaluation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single subordinate clause with common conjunctions (wenn, weil, dass)
    - Clear logical relationships between clauses
    - Familiar vocabulary in straightforward contexts
  medium:
    - Two subordinate clauses with different conjunction types
    - Nuanced relationships requiring appropriate conjunction choice
    - Mixed clause types in compound-complex sentences
  hard:
    - Three or more subordinate clauses with nested subordination
    - Subtle distinctions between similar conjunctions (obwohl vs. während)
    - Stylistic choices involving clause position and emphasis
prerequisites:
  - grade6-grammar-syntax
  - grade5-sentence-elements
  - grade4-sentence-structure
real_world_context:
  - Writing persuasive essays with conditional arguments to convince readers of a position
  - Analyzing news articles that use concessive clauses to present balanced viewpoints on controversial topics
  - Reading scientific texts that use adversative clauses to compare contrasting phenomena or experimental results
  - Crafting debate responses with consequential clauses to demonstrate logical connections between claims and evidence
  - Understanding complex instructions that combine multiple conditions and consequences in assembly manuals or recipes
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid more than three levels of clause embedding
  - Do not use archaic conjunctions like obschon, wiewohl unfamiliar to students
  - Avoid mixing conditional types (real vs. unreal) without clear context
  - Do not introduce subjunctive mood alongside complex clause structures
  - Avoid sentences exceeding 30 words even at hard difficulty
