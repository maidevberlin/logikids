Material-based writing requires students to work with multiple source texts to create new, coherent texts. This skill is essential for the materialgestütztes Schreiben format in MSA and Abitur exams. Students must extract relevant information, identify relationships between sources, and synthesize content while maintaining appropriate objectivity and structure.

The focus is on creating unified texts from diverse materials, not simply summarizing each source separately. Students must make decisions about organization, emphasis, and integration to produce texts that serve specific communicative purposes.
