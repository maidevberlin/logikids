# Describing Objects and Animals

Create a task where {{name}} practices descriptive writing appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Detailed Object Description
Ask the student to choose an everyday object (toy, school supply, piece of furniture, or household item) and write a detailed description including:
- **Color** and **size**
- **Shape** and **material**
- **Texture** (smooth, rough, soft, hard)
- **Purpose** and how it's used
- Special features

## Variation 2: Animal Portrait
Present a common animal (dog, cat, rabbit, bird, hamster) and guide the student to describe:
- **Physical appearance** (fur, feathers, eyes, ears, tail)
- **Movement** (how it walks, runs, jumps, flies)
- **Sounds** it makes
- **Typical behavior**
- Where it lives

## Variation 3: Sensory Description
Focus on using all five senses to describe an item (fruit, food, flower, or outdoor scene):
- What it **looks** like
- What it **sounds** like
- What it **smells** like
- What it **feels** like
- What it **tastes** like (if applicable)

## Variation 4: Mystery Description
Create a guessing game where the student describes something without naming it:
- Write 5-7 clues from general to specific
- Use precise adjectives
- Include size comparisons
- Describe what it's used for
- Let others guess what's being described

## Variation 5: Comparison Description
Have the student compare two similar items (two pets, two toys, two fruits):

| Feature | Item 1 | Item 2 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Color | | |
| Size | | |
| Texture | | |
| Special features | | |

Then write sentences highlighting the *similarities* and *differences*.

## Variation 6: Sequential Description
Describe something that changes over time or has parts in a specific order:
- A plant growing from seed to flower
- Seasons changing in nature
- A recipe being prepared step by step
- Morning routine from waking up to leaving for school

Use **temporal words**: *first, then, next, afterwards, finally*

## Variation 7: Precise Word Choice
Give the student a simple description with basic words (e.g., "The dog is nice and big") and ask them to rewrite it using more precise adjectives:
- Replace *nice* with: friendly, playful, gentle, loyal
- Replace *big* with: enormous, tall, heavy, muscular
- Add details about appearance, behavior, personality

## Variation 8: Structured Description Paragraph
Guide the student to write a complete descriptive paragraph with:
- **Opening sentence**: Introduce what is being described
- **Detail sentences** (3-5): Describe appearance, characteristics, special features
- **Closing sentence**: Personal opinion or summary
