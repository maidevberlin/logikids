# Fairy Tales

Create a task where {{name}} explores fairy tales appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds at {{difficulty}} level in {{language}}.

## Variation 1: Fairy Tale Elements Checklist
After reading a fairy tale, identify which typical elements are present:

**Fairy Tale Elements Checklist:**
- ☐ Begins with "Once upon a time" or similar
- ☐ Has magic (spells, enchantments, magical objects)
- ☐ Clear good characters
- ☐ Clear evil characters
- ☐ Numbers (3 wishes, 7 dwarfs, 12 months)
- ☐ Tasks or challenges to complete
- ☐ Transformation (frog to prince, etc.)
- ☐ Happy ending
- ☐ Good triumphs over evil
- ☐ Teaches a lesson

Count how many elements the fairy tale contains.

## Variation 2: Good vs Evil Characters
Create a character map separating good and evil:

| **Good Characters** | **Evil Characters** |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| How do we know they're good? | How do we know they're evil? |
| What do they do? | What do they do? |
| How are they described? | How are they described? |

Discuss:
- What makes a character good in fairy tales?
- What makes a character evil?
- Do any characters change from good to evil or vice versa?

## Variation 3: Comparing Fairy Tales
Choose two similar fairy tales and compare them:

**Example:** *Snow White* and *Sleeping Beauty*

| Element | Snow White | Sleeping Beauty |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Heroine | Snow White | Princess Aurora |
| Evil character | Stepmother | Evil fairy |
| Magic | Poisoned apple | Curse/spell |
| Helper | 7 dwarfs | Good fairies |
| How awakened | Prince's kiss | Prince's kiss |
| Ending | Marriage | Marriage |

What is similar? What is different?

## Variation 4: Fairy Tale Structure
Identify the typical structure of fairy tales:

**Beginning:**
- Introduction of characters
- Setting (time and place)
- Initial situation

**Middle:**
- Problem or challenge appears
- Evil character creates trouble
- Hero/heroine faces difficulties

**End:**
- Problem is solved
- Good defeats evil
- Happy ending
- Often a wedding

Apply this structure to a fairy tale you know.

## Variation 5: Magic Objects and Numbers
Find all the magical elements:

**Magic objects:**
- Mirror (Snow White)
- Spinning wheel (Sleeping Beauty)
- Glass slipper (Cinderella)
- Magic beans (Jack and the Beanstalk)

**Special numbers:**
- 3 (three wishes, three brothers)
- 7 (seven dwarfs, seven ravens)
- 12 (twelve months, twelve princesses)

Why do you think these numbers appear so often in fairy tales?

## Variation 6: Lessons and Morals
Discuss what lessons fairy tales teach:

| Fairy Tale | Lesson/Moral |
|------------|--------------|
| *Little Red Riding Hood* | Listen to warnings; don't talk to strangers |
| *The Hare and the Tortoise* | Slow and steady wins the race |
| *Cinderella* | Kindness is rewarded; goodness triumphs |
| *Hansel and Gretel* | Cleverness and courage overcome danger |

What lesson does your fairy tale teach?

## Variation 7: Rewriting the Ending
Take a well-known fairy tale and create an alternative ending:
- Keep the fairy tale style
- Keep the main characters
- Change what happens at the end
- Does good still win?
- Is there still magic?

**Example:** What if Cinderella didn't lose her slipper? What if the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood was actually friendly?

## Variation 8: Fairy Tale vs Real Life
Compare fairy tale world with real world:

| In Fairy Tales | In Real Life |
|----------------|-------------|
| Magic solves problems | We must solve problems ourselves |
| Clear good and evil | People are complex |
| Always happy ending | Not all stories end happily |
| Animals can talk | Animals don't speak human language |
| Wishes come true | We must work for what we want |

Discuss:
- What can we learn from fairy tales even though they're not real?
- Why do people still love fairy tales today?
