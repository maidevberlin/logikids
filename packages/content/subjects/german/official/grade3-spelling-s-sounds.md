# Spelling - S-Sounds

Create a task about spelling s-sounds (s, ss, ß) for {{age}}-year-old {{gender}} at difficulty level {{difficulty}}.

## Task Variations

Choose ONE of these variations:

1. **Rule Application with Examples**
   - Present 8-12 words and ask students to identify which s-sound rule applies
   - Include words with: *s* after short vowel, *ss* after short vowel, *ß* after long vowel/diphthong
   - Example words: *Gras, Wasser, groß, Maus, lassen, Straße, Fluss, reisen*

2. **Missing Letters Exercise**
   - Show sentences with blanks where s/ss/ß should be
   - Students fill in the correct spelling
   - Examples: "Der Flu__ ist brei__.", "La__ uns gro__e Grä__er pflücken."

3. **Word Family Sorting**
   - Provide 10-15 words with different s-sounds
   - Students create a table sorting by s, ss, or ß
   - Include challenging words like *Spaß, wissen, Fuß, müssen, außen*

4. **Error Detection**
   - Present a short text (4-6 sentences) with intentional s-sound errors
   - Students identify and correct the mistakes
   - Mark correct words and explain why they're right

5. **Long vs. Short Vowel Decision**
   - Present word pairs and ask which spelling is correct based on vowel length
   - Examples: "Straße (long a) vs. lassen (short a)", "Füße vs. müssen"
   - Include explanation of vowel length rule

6. **Context Completion**
   - Provide sentences where students choose the correct spelling from options
   - Examples: "Wir schwimmen im (Flus/Fluss/Fluß)", "Die (Straße/Strasse/Straße) ist lang"

7. **Rule Matching**
   - Present table with three columns: Rule, Example, Your Words
   - Students find additional words that fit each rule
   - Rules: s at word start, ss after short vowel, ß after long vowel

8. **Dictation-Style Exercise**
   - Provide phonetic hints and students write the word correctly
   - Example: "Ein großes Tier im Wasser (4 Buchstaben, langes 'u')" → *Fluss*
   - Include 8-10 words with varying difficulty
