# Discussion and Debate

Create {{count}} varied tasks about **structured discussions and debates** for a {{age}}-year-old student. Focus on {{focus_area}}.

## Task Variations

### Variation 1: Discussion Phrases
Students learn and practice standard phrases for discussions.

**Example:**
"Learn these essential discussion phrases:

**Expressing your opinion:**
- *'Ich bin der Meinung, dass...'* (I am of the opinion that...)
- *'Meiner Ansicht nach...'* (In my view...)
- *'Ich finde, dass...'* (I think that...)

**Agreeing:**
- *'Da hast du recht.'* (You're right about that.)
- *'Ich stimme dir zu.'* (I agree with you.)
- *'Genau, das sehe ich auch so.'* (Exactly, I see it the same way.)

**Disagreeing politely:**
- *'Ich sehe das anders.'* (I see it differently.)
- *'Ich verstehe deinen Punkt, aber...'* (I understand your point, but...)
- *'Da bin ich anderer Meinung.'* (I have a different opinion on that.)

**Asking for clarification:**
- *'Was meinst du genau damit?'* (What exactly do you mean by that?)
- *'Kannst du ein Beispiel geben?'* (Can you give an example?)

**Practice:** Use three different phrases in a discussion about 'Should students choose their own subjects?'"

### Variation 2: Preparing Arguments
Students structure arguments with claim, reason, and evidence.

**Example:**
"Prepare arguments using the **ARG structure** (Argument, Reason, Evidence):

**Topic:** Should school start later in the morning?

**Argument FOR:**
- **Claim:** Schools should start at 9:00 instead of 8:00.
- **Reason:** Teenagers need more sleep to concentrate better.
- **Evidence:** Studies show that students learn better when they get enough sleep. Many students are tired in first period.

**Argument AGAINST:**
- **Claim:** School should start at 8:00 as usual.
- **Reason:** Parents need to get to work and cannot bring children later.
- **Evidence:** Most workplaces start at 8:00 or earlier. Students would get home too late.

**Your turn:** Prepare 2 arguments FOR and 2 arguments AGAINST:
'Should students be allowed to use smartphones in school?'"

### Variation 3: Counter-Arguments
Students practice responding to opposing viewpoints.

**Example:**
"Learn to respond to counter-arguments constructively:

**Opponent says:** *'Homework is necessary because students need to practice at home.'*

**Response strategies:**

1. **Acknowledge + But:** *'Ich verstehe, dass Übung wichtig ist, aber...'*
   *'...man kann auch in der Schule üben.'*

2. **Alternative solution:** *'Statt Hausaufgaben könnten wir...'*
   *'...längere Übungszeiten in der Schule haben.'*

3. **Question the assumption:** *'Stimmt es wirklich, dass...'*
   *'...Hausaufgaben die beste Form der Übung sind?'*

4. **Add new perspective:** *'Hast du daran gedacht, dass...'*
   *'...manche Kinder zu Hause keine Hilfe bekommen?'*

**Practice:** Respond to this argument:
*'Schuluniformen sind gut, weil dann niemand wegen Kleidung gemobbt wird.'*"

### Variation 4: Debate Roles
Students practice different roles in a structured debate.

**Example:**
"In a debate, different people have different roles:

**Topic:** Should plastic bags be banned?

**Role 1 - Proposer (PRO):**
- Opens the debate
- Presents 2-3 main arguments FOR
- Responds to counter-arguments
- Summarizes why the proposition should be accepted

**Role 2 - Opposer (CONTRA):**
- Presents 2-3 main arguments AGAINST
- Challenges the proposer's arguments
- Offers alternative solutions
- Summarizes why the proposition should be rejected

**Role 3 - Moderator:**
- Introduces the topic
- Ensures both sides get equal speaking time
- Asks clarifying questions
- Summarizes the main points at the end

**Practice:** Choose a role and prepare your part for the debate about plastic bags."

### Variation 5: Finding Common Ground
Students practice identifying agreement and finding compromise.

**Example:**
"Even in disagreement, find what you agree on:

**Debate:** Should students get homework?

**Position A:** No homework! Students need free time.
**Position B:** Yes, homework! Students need practice.

**Step 1 - Find agreement:**
- Both agree: Students need to learn effectively
- Both agree: Students' wellbeing is important
- Both agree: Some subjects need practice

**Step 2 - Find middle ground:**
- Maybe: Only homework on certain days?
- Maybe: Maximum 30 minutes per subject?
- Maybe: More choice in what homework to do?

**Your turn:** Find common ground and compromise for:
'Students want longer breaks, teachers want more teaching time.'"

### Variation 6: Discussion Rules
Students learn and apply rules for fair discussions.

**Example:**
"Good discussions follow rules:

**Discussion Rules:**
1. **One person speaks at a time** - No interrupting
2. **Listen actively** - Look at the speaker, nod, show you're listening
3. **Stick to the topic** - Don't go off on tangents
4. **Be respectful** - Attack arguments, not people
5. **Give evidence** - Support claims with examples
6. **Allow response time** - Don't rush to answer

**Identify rule violations:**
*Anna: 'Ich denke, dass—'*
*Ben: 'Das ist doch völlig—'*
*Anna: 'Lass mich ausreden!'*
*Ben: 'Deine Meinung ist dumm!'*

**What went wrong? How should Ben respond?**"

### Variation 7: Body Language and Tone
Students learn how non-verbal communication affects discussions.

**Example:**
"Your body language and tone matter as much as your words:

**Compare these scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Aggressive:**
- Arms crossed
- Loud voice
- Interrupting
- *'Das ist total falsch!'*
- Rolling eyes

**Scenario B - Respectful:**
- Open posture
- Calm voice
- Waiting for turn
- *'Ich sehe das etwas anders...'*
- Making eye contact

**Practice:**
Say the same opinion in three different ways:
- Aggressive (how NOT to do it)
- Passive (too weak)
- Assertive (just right)

Opinion: *'Ich finde, wir sollten die Klassenfahrt nicht absagen.'*"

### Variation 8: Mini-Debate Preparation
Students prepare and conduct a complete short debate.

**Example:**
"Prepare a 5-minute mini-debate:

**Topic:** Should children under 12 be allowed to have social media accounts?

**Preparation (15 minutes):**

**PRO side:**
1. List 3 main arguments
2. Prepare examples/evidence for each
3. Anticipate 2 counter-arguments
4. Prepare responses

**CONTRA side:**
1. List 3 main arguments
2. Prepare examples/evidence for each
3. Anticipate 2 counter-arguments
4. Prepare responses

**Debate Structure:**
- Opening statements (1 min each)
- Counter-arguments (1 min each)
- Rebuttal (30 sec each)
- Closing statements (30 sec each)

**Your turn:** Choose a side and prepare your complete debate strategy."
