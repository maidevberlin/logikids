name: Writing Mechanics and Handwriting
description: Produce legible handwriting; adjust script for purpose (print vs. cursive); maintain proper posture and grip
grade: 3
focus: Writing mechanics and physical skills
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Produce legible and consistent personal handwriting at appropriate speed
  - Adjust script style for different purposes (print for diagrams, cursive for notes)
  - Maintain proper posture, grip, and writing pressure during extended writing
  - Monitor and self-correct handwriting quality through peer feedback
  - Format texts neatly with purposeful layout and visual organization
problem_types:
  - Handwriting evaluation
  - Script selection
  - Posture correction
  - Speed accuracy
  - Layout planning
  - Letter formation
  - Peer feedback
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single words or short phrases for handwriting practice
    - Basic print vs. cursive distinction scenarios
    - Simple posture/grip identification tasks
  medium:
    - Full sentences requiring consistent handwriting
    - Context-based script selection (labeling diagram, writing letter)
    - Multiple-aspect handwriting assessment (legibility, speed, neatness)
  hard:
    - Extended text passages maintaining quality throughout
    - Complex layout planning with sections and visual elements
    - Self-monitoring and improvement goal-setting scenarios
prerequisites:
  - grade1-handwriting
real_world_context:
  - Students label science diagrams clearly using print script so others can read the parts
  - A child writes cursive notes during a presentation to capture ideas quickly
  - Students review their writing posture after noticing hand fatigue during a long story
  - Classmates exchange handwriting samples and provide specific feedback on letter clarity
  - A student plans a final text layout with title, sections, and illustrations before copying neatly
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid technical typography terms inappropriate for 8-9 year olds
  - Don't focus on calligraphy or artistic lettering beyond legibility
  - Avoid ergonomic jargon; use simple language for posture and grip
  - Don't assess handwriting speed without considering legibility maintenance
  - Avoid scenarios requiring left-handed vs. right-handed distinctions
