  6. **Motif Recognition**: Find recurring motifs or symbols and explain their significance
  7. **Setting Analysis**: Analyze how time and place affect the story and characters
  8. **Conflict Analysis**: Identify the main conflicts (internal, external, person vs. person, person vs. society, etc.)
