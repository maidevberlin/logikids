description: Learning the German alphabet, alphabetical order, and using it for organizing and finding words
grade: 2
focus: Alphabetical ordering and reference skills
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Recite the German alphabet in correct order
  - Determine which letter comes before or after a given letter

  - Dictionary navigation
  - Alphabetical position finding
  - Ordering word lists
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single letters or 3-4 short words (3-5 letters each)
    - Focus on first letter only for sorting
    - Adjacent letters in alphabet (e.g., M-N-O)
  medium:
    - 5-6 words of varying lengths
    - Sorting requires checking second letter when first letters match
    - Non-adjacent letters spanning more of the alphabet
  hard:
    - 7-8 words including some with identical first letters
