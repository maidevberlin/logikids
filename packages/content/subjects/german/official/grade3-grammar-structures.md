real_world_context:
  - Students use compound words when describing objects in science class or labeling diagrams in art projects
  - Children apply verb tenses when writing diary entries about past events or planning future activities

  - Combining sentences with conjunctions helps students write more sophisticated reports and arguments
  - Understanding parts of speech supports dictionary use and learning foreign languages in later grades
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid compound words longer than three components for grade 3
  - Do not mix subjunctive mood or passive voice in verb tense tasks
  - Avoid dative-accusative distinction beyond basic prepositional phrases
  - Do not use archaic or literary conjunctions unfamiliar to 8-9 year olds
