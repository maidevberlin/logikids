# Melody Pattern Tasks

Create melodic pattern recognition problems that help students understand pitch progression and develop their musical ear. Tasks should focus on identifying patterns, predicting sequences, and understanding melodic direction.

**Vary the melodic pattern structure:**
- **Vary step-wise sequences**: Present ascending or descending patterns moving by whole or half steps (e.g., C-D-E-F or A-G-F-E)
- **Vary skip patterns**: Use patterns that skip notes (e.g., C-E-G or D-F-A for triads)
- **Vary repeating motifs**: Show patterns with repeated melodic fragments (e.g., C-D-E, C-D-E, C-D-?)
- **Vary alternating patterns**: Create melodies that alternate directions (e.g., C up to E, down to D, up to F, down to ?)
- **Vary interval jumps**: Include patterns with specific interval jumps (thirds, fourths, fifths)
- **Vary melodic completion**: Give partial melodies and ask for the missing note(s)
- **Vary contour identification**: Present multiple melodies and ask which follows a specific shape (ascending, descending, arch-shaped, valley-shaped)
- **Vary scale-based patterns**: Use major or minor scale segments (e.g., do-re-mi-fa or la-sol-fa-mi)

**Vary the musical context:**
- **Simple note names** with letter notation (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)
- **Solfège syllables** (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti)
- **Familiar song fragments** ("first three notes of 'Twinkle Twinkle'")
- **Numeric scale degrees** (1-2-3-4-5 or 5-4-3-2-1)
- **Visual representations** using high/low position markers
- **Instrument-specific contexts** (piano keys, guitar strings, xylophone bars)
- **Melodic phrases** from well-known children's songs

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- For younger students ({{age}} < 10): Use 3-5 note sequences, stick to simple major scales, focus on step-wise motion
- For middle students ({{age}} 10-12): Use 5-7 note sequences, introduce skips and simple intervals, mix directions
- For older students ({{age}} >= 13): Use longer sequences (7-10 notes), include chromatic notes, complex intervals, and mixed patterns

**Present information clearly:**
Use **bold** for musical terms (**ascending**, **descending**, **pitch**, **interval**).

For multiple melodic options, use tables:

| Melody A | Melody B | Melody C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| C-D-E-F  | C-E-D-F  | C-B-A-G  |

Adjust difficulty to {{difficulty}} by:
- **easy**: 3-4 notes, clear step-wise patterns, obvious answers
- **medium**: 5-6 notes, mix of steps and skips, some variation
- **hard**: 7+ notes, complex intervals, chromatic notes, less obvious patterns
