# Rhythm Recognition Tasks

Create rhythmic pattern problems that help students develop their sense of timing and recognize different beat patterns. Tasks should focus on identifying rhythms, comparing durations, and understanding musical pulse.

**Vary the rhythmic pattern structure:**
- **Vary repeating patterns**: Present patterns that repeat (e.g., short-short-long, short-short-long, ?)
- **Vary pattern completion**: Give partial rhythm sequences and ask for the missing beat (e.g., long-short-short-?)
- **Vary pattern comparison**: Compare two or more rhythms to identify differences or similarities
- **Vary beat counting**: Ask students to count total beats in a rhythmic phrase
- **Vary duration relationships**: Compare note values (which is longer: two quarters or one half?)
- **Vary syncopation**: Include off-beat patterns for older students (short-LONG-short vs. LONG-short-LONG)
- **Vary rest patterns**: Include silent beats/rests in rhythmic sequences (long-REST-short-short)
- **Vary time signature contexts**: Present patterns in different meters (4/4, 3/4, 6/8)

**Vary the notation and representation:**
- **Text descriptions**: "long-short-short" or "quarter-quarter-half"
- **Unicode symbols**: ♩ ♪ 𝅗𝅥 (quarter, eighth, half notes)
- **Word syllables**: "ta ta ti-ti ta" or "du du du-de du"
- **Clapping notation**: CLAP-clap-clap-CLAP (capitals for accents)
- **Drum sounds**: "boom-tick-tick-boom" or "bass-snare-snare-bass"
- **Visual spacing**: Use spaces to show timing (long    short short    long)
- **Number notation**: 1 2 1-and-2 or 1...2.1.2
- **Action words**: "stomp-tap-tap-stomp" or "step-hop-hop-step"

**Vary the musical context:**
- **Body percussion** (clapping, stomping, patting)
- **Drum patterns** (bass drum, snare, hi-hat combinations)
- **Familiar songs** ("rhythm of 'Happy Birthday' first line")
- **Dance contexts** (waltz rhythm, march rhythm, gallop)
- **Instrument-specific** (guitar strumming patterns, piano rhythms)
- **Nature sounds** (heartbeat, walking pace, horse galloping)
- **Sports movements** (dribbling patterns, jumping rope)

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- For younger students ({{age}} < 10): Use 3-4 beat patterns, simple long/short distinctions, clear repetitions
- For middle students ({{age}} 10-12): Use 5-6 beat patterns, introduce eighth notes, simple rests, basic syncopation
- For older students ({{age}} >= 13): Use complex patterns (8+ beats), dotted rhythms, multiple rest types, compound meters, polyrhythms

**Present information clearly:**
Use **bold** for rhythmic terms (**beat**, **quarter note**, **rest**, **tempo**, **accent**).

For comparing multiple rhythms, use tables:

| Pattern A | Pattern B | Pattern C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ♩♩♪♪♩    | ♩♪♪♩♩    | ♪♪♩♩♩    |

Or with text:
| Pattern A | Pattern B | Pattern C |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| long-long-short-short | long-short-short-long | short-short-long-long |

Adjust difficulty to {{difficulty}} by:
- **easy**: 3-4 beats, only 2 different durations, obvious patterns, clear repetitions
- **medium**: 5-6 beats, 3 different durations, some variation, may include one rest
- **hard**: 7+ beats, multiple durations, complex syncopation, multiple rests, irregular patterns
