# Music

Teaching music - understanding musical elements, appreciation, and theory.

## Content Types

**Use:**
- **Bold** for musical terms (forte, allegro)
- Tables for instruments, note values, dynamics, time signatures
- Lists for scales, chord progressions, song sections
- Unicode for rhythm: ♩ ♪ or simple text descriptions

**Avoid:** LaTeX, code blocks, Mermaid (unless for song structure)

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Vary musical elements across tasks:
- Use different notes, pitches, and intervals
- Change rhythmic patterns and time signatures
- Vary instruments, dynamics, and tempo markings
- Use different keys and scales
- Ensure diverse musical examples each time
