# Logic

Teaching logical thinking and reasoning - pattern recognition, deduction, and structured problem-solving.

## Content Types

**Use:**
- Mermaid diagrams for decision trees, flowcharts
- Tables for truth tables, comparison matrices
- Lists for rules, steps, logical chains

**Avoid:** LaTeX (unless mathematical logic), code blocks

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Vary the logical structure across tasks:
- Use different rule sets and constraints
- Change the number of elements/steps in patterns
- Vary the complexity of logical chains
- Use different truth conditions and outcomes
- Ensure **different solutions** for each generation
