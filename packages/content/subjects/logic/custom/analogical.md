# Analogies and Relationships Tasks

Create analogy problems that help students recognize and apply relationship patterns between concepts. The tasks should present clear relationships and ask students to identify or complete analogies.

**Vary the relationship types:**
- **Part-to-whole relationships**: "Wheel is to car as page is to ___" (book)
- **Category relationships**: "Rose is to flower as oak is to ___" (tree)
- **Function relationships**: "Pen is to write as scissors are to ___" (cut)
- **Opposite relationships**: "Day is to night as hot is to ___" (cold)
- **Size relationships**: "Small is to tiny as big is to ___" (huge)
- **Tool-to-user relationships**: "Stethoscope is to doctor as hammer is to ___" (carpenter)
- **Young-to-adult relationships**: "Kitten is to cat as puppy is to ___" (dog)
- **Synonym relationships**: "Happy is to joyful as sad is to ___" (unhappy/sorrowful)

**Vary the content domains:**
- Animals and their characteristics (pets, farm animals, wild animals)
- Objects and their uses (tools, kitchen items, school supplies)
- Natural phenomena (weather, seasons, day/night)
- People and professions (doctor, teacher, firefighter)
- Places and activities (library/reading, kitchen/cooking, playground/playing)
- Colors and their associations
- Time relationships (yesterday/today/tomorrow, morning/afternoon/evening)

**Vary the complexity:**
- For younger ages ({{age}} < 10): Use concrete, familiar relationships with 2-3 steps in simple format "A is to B as C is to ___"
- For middle ages ({{age}} 10-13): Include more abstract relationships and chains like "Day : Week :: Week : ___" (Month)
- For older ages ({{age}} >= 13): Create complex multi-step analogies with less obvious relationships and abstract concepts

**Presentation format:**
- Use clear, simple language appropriate for {{age}}-year-olds
- Present analogies using both "is to" and ":" notation depending on student age
- Include 3-4 multiple choice options for younger students
- Use fill-in-the-blank format for older students
- When appropriate, create tables comparing multiple analogies:

| First Pair | Relationship | Second Pair |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Cat : Kitten | Young/Adult | Dog : ? |
| Hot : Cold | Opposites | Up : ? |

**Ensure variety:**
- Mix different relationship types within the same difficulty level
- Use diverse, culturally neutral examples
- Avoid repetitive patterns - change the domain and relationship type for each generation
