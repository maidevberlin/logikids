# History

Teaching history - understanding the past through analysis of sources, events, and their connections to the present.

## Content Types

**Use:**

- **Bold** for key terms, dates, and important figures
- _Italic_ for quotes, book titles, document names
- Tables for timelines, comparisons between periods, cause-effect relationships
- Lists for events, characteristics of eras, key developments

**Important:** Use historically accurate information and ensure age-appropriate complexity

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure diversity across task generations:

- Use different historical periods and events
- Vary perspectives (political, social, cultural, economic)
- Change the specific figures, places, and dates
- Ensure **different examples** each time
- Use varied contexts (local, national, global history)
