  - Explain how Greece's mountainous landscape shaped the development of independent city-states
  - Describe the key features and organization of a Greek polis
  - Identify major Greek city-states and their distinct characteristics (Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes)
  - Analyze the reasons for Greek colonization around the Mediterranean and Black Sea
  - Explain the relationship between mother cities (metropoleis) and their colonies (apoikiai)
  - Trace the spread of Greek culture through colonization and trade networks
problem_types:

  - City-state comparison
  - Colonization mapping
  - Political structure identification
  - Trade route tracing
  - Cultural diffusion analysis
  - Timeline sequencing
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify basic features of a polis (acropolis, agora, walls)
    - Name major city-states and their locations
    - Explain simple geographic influences (mountains, islands, sea)
  medium:
    - Compare different city-states and their characteristics
    - Analyze multiple reasons for colonization (overpopulation, trade, resources)
    - Connect geography to specific political developments
  hard:
    - Evaluate the long-term impact of the polis system on Greek identity
    - Synthesize geographic, economic, and political factors in colonization
    - Analyze relationships between mother cities and colonies
real_world_context:
  - A Greek merchant travels from Athens to a colony in Sicily to trade olive oil and pottery
  - City planners in ancient Miletus design a new colony with an agora, temples, and defensive walls
  - Spartans and Athenians meet at the Olympic Games, representing their different city-states
  - A family from Corinth sails to establish a new colony on the Black Sea coast due to farmland shortages
  - Greek colonists bring their alphabet, gods, and architectural styles to southern Italy (Magna Graecia)
  - Sailors navigate between Greek islands, stopping at different poleis for trade and supplies
  - Citizens gather in the agora of Thebes to discuss politics, trade goods, and hear news
  - A Greek colony sends a delegation back to its mother city for religious festivals and advice
  - Farmers on the rocky hillsides of Greece struggle with limited arable land, prompting migration
  - Greek traders establish trading posts along the Mediterranean coast, spreading their language and customs
  - City-states compete for control of strategic locations like the Hellespont for grain shipments
  - Craftsmen in a Greek colony produce distinctive pottery that blends local and Greek artistic traditions
  - Mountain ranges separate neighboring city-states, leading to different dialects and customs
  - A polis builds defensive walls on its acropolis to protect against rival city-states
  - Greek colonists encounter indigenous peoples and establish trade relationships or conflicts
anti_patterns:
  - Don't confuse Greek city-states with modern nation-states or unified countries
  - Avoid treating all poleis as identical - emphasize diversity between city-states
  - Don't oversimplify colonization as purely economic; include social and political factors
  - Avoid anachronistic terms like "democracy" when discussing general polis structure
  - Don't use examples from later periods (Hellenistic, Roman) for archaic colonization
