  - Technology assessment
  - Impact evaluation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Basic facts about Gutenberg's invention and Columbus's voyage (1492)
    - Simple maps showing exploration routes
    - Identifying direct consequences of technological innovations
  medium:
    - Connections between printing press and knowledge spread
    - Multiple motivations for exploration (economic, religious, political)
    - Comparing European and indigenous perspectives
  hard:
    - Long-term societal transformations caused by printing technology
    - Analyzing conflicting historical sources about first encounters
    - Evaluating the term "discovery" and its implications
prerequisites:
  - grade7-renaissance
  - grade7-medieval-cities
real_world_context:
  - A village celebrates the 550th anniversary of their local printing workshop
  - Museum curators debate how to present Columbus's voyages in a new exhibition
  - Students compare how news spread in 1450 versus 1500 versus today
  - A library displays original books from before and after the printing press invention
  - Archaeologists uncover indigenous artifacts predating Columbus's arrival
  - Historians examine ship logs and maps from 15th-century Portuguese explorers
  - A documentary filmmaker interviews descendants of Taino people about 1492
  - Students recreate Gutenberg's printing process in a history workshop
  - A debate competition discusses whether Columbus should be celebrated or criticized
  - Navigators explain how 15th-century sailors used astrolabes and compasses
  - Researchers compare handwritten manuscripts with early printed books
  - A theater group performs scenes showing different perspectives of first contact
  - Students trace trade routes connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas
  - Book collectors examine how printing democratized access to knowledge
  - Indigenous communities share oral histories passed down from the pre-Columbian era
anti_patterns:
  - Don't oversimplify Columbus's legacy without acknowledging multiple perspectives
  - Avoid presenting indigenous peoples as passive or primitive
  - Don't assume students know what manuscripts or movable type are
  - Avoid anachronistic technology comparisons (no internet references for 1492)
  - Don't conflate different indigenous civilizations into one generic group
