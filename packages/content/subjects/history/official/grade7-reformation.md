  - Refugees flee from regions where their religion is banned to territories that accept their faith
  - A pamphleteer creates a satirical woodcut showing the Pope as a corrupt figure selling salvation
  - Monks and nuns leave their monasteries after Luther declares that clergy should be allowed to marry

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid presenting the Reformation as solely about religious ideas without economic/political context
  - Don't oversimplify Catholic vs. Protestant differences into good vs. bad
  - Avoid anachronistic concepts like modern religious tolerance or separation of church and state
  - Don't present witch persecution as purely medieval (it peaked in 16th-17th centuries)
  - Avoid ignoring Luther's problematic positions (peasants, Jews) while praising reform
