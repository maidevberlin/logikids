# Cell Structure and Function Tasks

Create biology problems that explore cellular structures, organelle functions, and the organizational hierarchy from cells to organisms. Tasks should help students understand both plant and animal cells, recognize differences between cell types, and apply systems thinking to biological organization.

## Vary the problem structure:

Generate diverse question types that test understanding from different angles:

- **Cell identification and labeling**: Describe or show a cell structure and ask students to identify whether it's a plant cell or animal cell based on specific features, or to label key organelles in a diagram
- **Organelle function matching**: Present organelles and their functions, asking students to match structures with their roles (energy production, protein synthesis, storage, photosynthesis, protection)
- **Comparative analysis**: Compare plant and animal cells, identifying which structures are found in both, which are unique to plants, and which are unique to animals
- **Hierarchy organization**: Given examples of biological structures, ask students to arrange them in order from smallest to largest or identify which level of organization they represent
- **Microscopy interpretation**: Describe what would be visible under a microscope at different magnifications or with different staining techniques, or ask students to interpret microscopic observations
- **Structure-function relationships**: Present a cellular structure and ask students to explain how its structure enables its function, or vice versa
- **Cell specialization**: Describe specialized cells and ask students to identify which features enable their specific functions
- **Unicellular vs multicellular**: Compare organisms based on cellular organization and explain advantages or challenges of each organizational strategy
- **Experimental design**: Ask students to design simple experiments to observe cellular structures or test cellular functions
- **Cell membrane processes**: Describe scenarios involving substance transport across cell membranes and ask about mechanisms or outcomes

## Vary the content/context:

Use diverse examples across different organism types and contexts:

- **Plant cells**: Leaf cells (with many chloroplasts), root cells (with large central vacuole), stem cells, pollen cells, guard cells
- **Animal cells**: Human cheek cells, nerve cells (neurons), muscle cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, skin cells
- **Unicellular organisms**: Bacteria (prokaryotic structure), amoeba (eukaryotic protist), paramecium (with cilia), euglena (with both plant-like and animal-like features)
- **Tissue types**: Epithelial tissue, muscle tissue, connective tissue, plant ground tissue, plant vascular tissue
- **Organ examples**: Leaf (photosynthesis), root (absorption), heart (pumping), brain (coordination), stomach (digestion)
- **Real-world applications**: Microscopy in medicine, cell cultures in research, understanding disease at cellular level, agricultural applications
- **Observable contexts**: Onion skin cells (classic microscopy), elodea leaf cells (visible chloroplasts), cork cells (historical discovery), pond water microorganisms

## Vary the complexity based on age:

Scale difficulty appropriately for student developmental level:

- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 13): Focus on basic cell structures visible in diagrams (nucleus, cell membrane, cell wall, chloroplasts, vacuole). Use simple identification tasks. Emphasize visual recognition. Compare only major differences between plant and animal cells. Introduce basic hierarchy concepts (cells form tissues, tissues form organs). Use familiar examples (human body, common plants). Keep terminology to essential organelles only.

- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 13-14): Include more organelles (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi apparatus). Require understanding of organelle functions, not just identification. Ask students to explain structure-function relationships. Compare multiple cell types and their specializations. Work with all levels of biological hierarchy. Introduce eukaryotic vs prokaryotic concepts. Use microscopy interpretation tasks.

- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 14): Expect detailed knowledge of all major organelles and their interactions. Require multi-step reasoning about cellular processes. Ask for explanations of cellular mechanisms. Include experimental design and hypothesis testing. Compare cells across kingdoms (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria). Discuss cellular specialization in depth. Connect cellular structure to molecular processes.

## Vary the difficulty:

- **Easy**: Identify basic structures in clearly labeled diagrams. Match organelles with simple function descriptions (one-to-one matching). Distinguish between plant and animal cells using obvious features (cell wall, chloroplasts). List structures in correct hierarchical order when given the sequence. Recognize common cell types from descriptions.

- **Medium**: Explain why specific structures are present or absent in different cell types. Predict which organelles would be most abundant in cells with particular functions. Interpret unlabeled microscopy observations to identify cell type. Organize biological hierarchy levels from mixed examples. Compare and contrast multiple cell types simultaneously. Apply structure-function reasoning to unfamiliar scenarios.

- **Hard**: Analyze complex scenarios involving multiple cellular processes. Design experiments to investigate cellular structures or functions with proper controls. Explain cascading effects of organelle malfunction across biological hierarchy levels. Integrate knowledge across multiple concepts (structure, function, hierarchy, specialization). Evaluate evidence to draw conclusions about cell type or function. Justify classification decisions using multiple criteria.

## Use appropriate formats:

**Tables for comparisons:**
Create tables comparing plant and animal cells, showing which structures are present or absent, or comparing different cell types and their characteristics. Use tables for organizing hierarchy levels or for experimental data presentation.

**Lists for processes and sequences:**
Use ordered lists when describing steps in cellular processes, hierarchical organization levels, or sequences of observations during microscopy. Use unordered lists for characteristics, features, or collections of examples.

**SVG diagrams for cellular structures:**
Describe what diagrams should show, not how to code them. Diagrams should illustrate cell shapes (rectangular for plant cells, irregular/rounded for animal cells), organelle positions and relative sizes, membrane boundaries, and key distinguishing features. For hierarchy diagrams, show progression from cells to tissues to organs to organ systems to organisms. For comparison diagrams, place plant and animal cells side-by-side with corresponding structures aligned.

**LaTeX for scientific notation:**
Use scientific notation when expressing very large numbers (number of cells in human body) or very small measurements (cell sizes in micrometers). Express dimensions using proper units with appropriate prefixes (μm for micrometers, nm for nanometers).

## Important guidelines:

**Variation in numerical values:**
When using measurements, vary across multiple orders of magnitude. Typical cell sizes range from very small (bacteria at fractions of a micrometer) to very large (some plant cells at hundreds of micrometers). Number of cells varies from one (unicellular) to trillions (human body). Use diverse scales appropriate to the concept being taught.

**Diverse examples across kingdoms:**
Ensure variety across plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. Don't repeatedly use the same example organisms (onion cells, human cheek cells). Explore diverse contexts (aquatic organisms, terrestrial organisms, different plant parts, different animal tissues).

**Avoid repetitive phrasing:**
Don't use formulaic language like "Identify the cell type based on the following characteristics" for every identification question. Vary question stems, presentation formats, and approaches to testing the same underlying concept.

**Connect to curriculum standards:**
Emphasize systems thinking by requiring students to switch between organizational levels. Highlight structure-function relationships as a core biological principle. Use hands-on contexts (microscopy, specimen preparation) when possible. Connect cellular knowledge to organism-level phenomena students can observe.

**Age-appropriate terminology:**
For younger students, use common names and simple descriptions. For older students, introduce proper scientific terminology (eukaryotic, prokaryotic, organelle names in Latin/Greek). Scale vocabulary complexity to match developmental level while maintaining scientific accuracy.
