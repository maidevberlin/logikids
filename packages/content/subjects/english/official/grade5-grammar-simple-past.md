# Grammar - Simple Past

Create tasks that help students form and use Simple Past tense for completed actions and storytelling.

**Task Requirements:**
- Practice BOTH regular (-ed) and irregular past forms
- Use meaningful contexts (personal experiences, stories)
- Include time markers (yesterday, last week, ago)
- Practice affirmative, negative, and question forms
- Focus on common irregular verbs (go-went, see-saw, eat-ate, have-had)
- Make learning through stories and narratives
- Age-appropriate for 10-11 year olds

**Generate varied task types:**

## Variation 1: Regular Verbs - Adding -ed
Practice forming past tense of regular verbs.

**Example:**

**Today vs Yesterday**

Change these sentences from today to yesterday:

| Today (Present) | Yesterday (Past) |
|----------------|------------------|
| I play football. | I **played** football. |
| She watches TV. | She **watched** TV. |
| We visit our grandparents. | We **visited** our grandparents. |
| They walk to school. | They **walked** to school. |

**Now you try:**
1. I help my mum. → Yesterday, I _____ my mum. (helped)
2. She listens to music. → Yesterday, she _____ to music. (listened)
3. We work hard. → Yesterday, we _____ hard. (worked)

**Remember:** Most verbs → add **-ed**

## Variation 2: Irregular Verbs Practice
Learn common irregular past forms through context.

**Example:**

**Irregular Verb Story - Complete the gaps:**

Yesterday was a great day! I _____ (go) to the zoo with my family. We _____ (see) lots of animals. I _____ (eat) an ice cream. My sister _____ (have) a hot dog. We _____ (take) many photos. I _____ (buy) a toy elephant. We _____ (come) home at 5 o'clock. I _____ (feel) very happy!

**Word bank:** *went, saw, ate, had, took, bought, came, felt*

**Common irregular verbs:**
- go → went
- see → saw
- eat → ate
- have → had
- take → took
- buy → bought
- come → came
- feel → felt

## Variation 3: Past Tense Story Completion
Complete a story using the correct past tense forms.

**Example:**

**The Best Weekend**

Last weekend _____ (be) amazing! On Saturday, I _____ (wake up) late. I _____ (not go) to school because it was the weekend. I _____ (play) computer games and _____ (watch) my favorite film.

On Sunday, my family _____ (visit) my grandparents. We _____ (have) a big lunch. Grandma _____ (cook) my favorite food! In the afternoon, I _____ (help) grandpa in the garden. We _____ (plant) some flowers.

I _____ (enjoy) my weekend!

## Variation 4: Question Formation in Past Tense
Form and answer questions about the past.

**Example:**

   Answer: Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.

2. she / watch / TV last night?
   → **Did she watch TV last night?**

3. they / play / football / last weekend?

1. Tom went to school. → Tom **didn't go** to school.
2. He ate breakfast. → He **didn't eat** breakfast.
3. He played football. → He **didn't play** football.
4. He watched TV. → He **didn't watch** TV.
5. He did his homework. → He **didn't do** his homework.

**Remember:** didn't + verb (not didn't + past form!)

## Variation 6: Time Marker Matching

## Variation 7: Personal Weekend Report

4. We are at home last night. ❌
   → We **were** at home last night. ✓
