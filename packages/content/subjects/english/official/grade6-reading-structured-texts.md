# Reading - Structured Texts

Create reading comprehension tasks using well-organized, longer texts (200-400 words) with clear structure across different genres and purposes.

## Task Variations

### 1. Structured Correspondence (Emails, Formal Letters)
Read **longer correspondence** about {{topic}} and demonstrate comprehension:
- Identify **purpose** and **main message**
- Extract **specific information** (dates, places, requests)
- Understand the **relationship** between sender and recipient
- Note **actions required** or **information shared**

Example topics: holiday arrangements, school trip details, invitation with logistics, information request and response

> Example comprehension questions:
> - What is the writer asking for?
> - When will the event take place?
> - What should the recipient bring or do?
> - How does the writer feel about the topic?

### 2. Detailed Instructions and Guidelines
Read **multi-step instructions** or **guidelines** for {{activity}}:
- Understand **sequence** and **dependencies** (what must happen first)
- Identify **materials** or **requirements**
- Note **warnings**, **tips**, or **important details**
- Follow **conditional instructions** (if X, then Y)

| Text Type | What to Read For |
|-----------|------------------|
| Science experiment | Materials, steps, safety, expected results |
| Game rules | Setup, how to play, winning conditions |
| Assembly instructions | Parts needed, order of steps, diagrams |
| Safety guidelines | Rules, reasons, consequences |

### 3. Factual and Informational Texts
Read **structured informational articles** about {{subject}}:
- Identify **text structure** (cause-effect, problem-solution, compare-contrast, chronological)
- Find **main idea** of each paragraph or section
- Extract and organize **key facts**
- Understand **relationships** between ideas

Example subjects: how solar panels work, endangered species conservation, historical events, cultural practices, scientific discoveries

### 4. Literary Texts - Longer Excerpts
Read **chapter or extended excerpt** from {{genre}} and analyze:
- **Central theme** or message
- **Plot development** and **key events**
- **Character** traits, motivations, changes
- **Setting** and its significance
- **Literary elements** (conflict, resolution, point of view)

| Element | Questions to Consider |
|---------|----------------------|
| Theme | What is the story really about? What's the deeper message? |
| Characters | Who are they? How do they change? What do they want? |
| Plot | What happens? What's the main problem? How is it solved? |
| Setting | Where and when? How does this affect the story? |

Example genres: realistic fiction, adventure, mystery, historical fiction, fantasy

### 5. Text Organization and Structure
Analyze how **texts are organized** in {{text_type}}:
- Identify **headings** and **subheadings**
- Understand function of **introductions** and **conclusions**
- Recognize **topic sentences** and **supporting details**
- Use **text features** (bold text, bullet points, numbering)

**Task**: Read text about {{topic}} and create an outline showing its structure.

### 6. Information Synthesis from Multiple Paragraphs
Read **longer texts** (3-5 paragraphs) and **synthesize information**:
- Combine information from different paragraphs
- Make **inferences** based on multiple pieces of information
- Understand **how paragraphs connect** to each other
- Create **summaries** that integrate key points

> Reading Strategy: **SQ3R Method**
> 1. **Survey**: Look at headings, pictures, first sentences
> 2. **Question**: Turn headings into questions
> 3. **Read**: Read to answer your questions
> 4. **Recite**: Say or write main ideas in your own words
> 5. **Review**: Go back over the text

### 7. Critical Reading for Details
Practice **close reading** of {{text}} to find:
- **Explicitly stated information** (directly written)
- **Implied information** (suggested but not stated)
- **Supporting evidence** for claims
- **Differences between facts** and **opinions**

Example text types: persuasive article, book review, advertisement analysis, news report

### 8. Following Multi-Step Procedures in Text
Read **procedural texts** explaining {{process}}:
- Understand the **overall goal**
- Follow **sequential steps**
- Recognize **cause-and-effect relationships**
- Apply instructions to **hypothetical situations**

Example processes: how ecosystems work, how to conduct research, steps in a historical event, how technology functions

**Reading Comprehension Strategies**:

1. **Before Reading**:
   - Preview the text (title, headings, images)
   - Activate prior knowledge
   - Set a purpose for reading

2. **During Reading**:
   - Monitor understanding (does this make sense?)
   - Use context clues for unknown words
   - Make connections and predictions
   - Visualize information

3. **After Reading**:
   - Summarize main ideas
   - Reflect on what was learned
   - Review confusing parts
   - Apply information

**Text Features to Use**:
- **Visual aids**: Diagrams, charts, photographs
- **Text organizers**: Headings, bold words, bullet points
- **Textual supports**: Glossaries, captions, sidebars

**Important**: Texts should be **clearly structured** with logical organization, written in **age-appropriate language** (Grade 6 level), be **200-400 words** in length, include **familiar vocabulary** with some new words inferable from context, and use **appropriate text features** (headings, formatting) to aid comprehension. Questions should require both **literal comprehension** and **inferential thinking**.
