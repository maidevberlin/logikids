# Mediation - Introduction

Create tasks that help students convey information between English and German in simple, practical situations.

**Task Requirements:**
- Focus on conveying KEY information, not word-for-word translation
- Use realistic scenarios (invitations, signs, simple messages)
- Practice BOTH directions (English→German, German→English)
- Keep language simple and age-appropriate
- Make tasks practical and meaningful
- Emphasize understanding and communication over perfect translation
- Age-appropriate for 9-10 year olds

**Generate varied task types:**

## Variation 1: Invitation Information Transfer
Read an English invitation and convey the important details in German.

**Example:**
Read this invitation:

> **You're Invited!**
>
> Come to Emma's Birthday Party!
>
> When: Saturday, June 15th, 2:00 PM
> Where: 23 Oak Street
> What: Games, cake, and fun!
> Please bring: Nothing - just yourself!

**Task:** Your German-speaking friend wants to know about the party. Tell them in German:
- Wann ist die Party? (When is the party?)
- Wo ist die Party? (Where is the party?)
- Was machen sie? (What will they do?)
- Was soll man mitbringen? (What should you bring?)

## Variation 2: Sign Translation Task
Help someone understand English signs by explaining them in German.

**Example:**
You see these signs in English:

1. "Opening Hours: 9:00 - 17:00"
2. "Please Keep Off the Grass"
3. "Lost and Found - Ask at Reception"

## Variation 3: English Information to German

Answer in German:
- An welchen Tagen hat Tom Schule? (Which days does Tom have school?)
