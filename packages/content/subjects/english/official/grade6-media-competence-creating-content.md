# Media Competence - Creating Content

Create tasks where students produce their own digital media content in English while learning proper citation, editing skills, and critical reflection.

## Task Variations

### 1. Digital Presentations
Create a **presentation** (slides) about {{topic}} in English:
- Use **clear structure** (introduction, main points, conclusion)
- Include **relevant images** or graphics
- Keep text **concise** (bullet points, not full paragraphs)
- Cite **sources** for information and images

| Slide Purpose | What to Include |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Title slide | Topic, your name, date |
| Introduction | What the presentation is about |
| Main content | Key information, images, facts |
| Conclusion | Summary, final thoughts |
| Sources | Where information came from |

Example topics: favorite animal, interesting country, historical figure, hobby explanation

### 2. Video or Audio Recording
Produce a **short video** or **audio recording** (1-2 minutes) about {{subject}}:
- **Script** or plan what to say
- Record with **clear pronunciation**
- Include **introduction** and **conclusion**
- Edit if possible (cut mistakes, add simple effects)

Example formats: tutorial, book review, tour of room/school, explanation of process, storytelling

### 3. Blog Post or Article Writing
Write a **blog-style post** or **article** about {{topic}}:
- Use appropriate **structure** (headline, intro, body paragraphs, ending)
- Include **links** or **references** to sources
- Add relevant **images** with captions
- Cite sources using simple format

> Example citation format:
> "According to the National Geographic Kids website, dolphins can swim up to 20 miles per hour."
> **Source**: National Geographic Kids - Dolphin Facts

### 4. Proper Source Citation
Practice **citing sources** correctly:
- Website: *Title, Website Name, URL (accessed date)*
- Book: *Author, Title, Year*
- Video: *Title, Creator, Platform, Date*

**Task**: Find information about {{topic}} from three different sources and cite each properly.

Example citation practice:
- "The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889." *Source: Paris Guide, www.example.com (accessed Nov 2025)*

### 5. Infographic or Poster Design
Create a **visual presentation** of information about {{topic}}:
- Organize information **visually**
- Use **graphics** and **minimal text**
- Create clear **hierarchy** (what's most important)
- Include **source attribution**

| Design Element | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Title | Clear topic statement |
| Visuals | Icons, images, charts to show information |
| Text | Short facts, key points |
| Colors | Organize and highlight important info |
| Credits | Sources and creator name |

Example topics: water cycle, healthy eating, animal habitats, historical timeline

### 6. Critical Media Reflection
Analyze and reflect on **media content** (own or others'):
- What is the **purpose** of this media?
- Who is the **target audience**?
- What **techniques** are used to engage viewers?
- How **effective** is it?
- What could be **improved**?

**Activity**: Review a sample media product (video, poster, article) about {{topic}} and write a critical reflection.

### 7. Collaborative Digital Project
Work on a **group media project** where students:
- Plan **together** what to create
- **Divide tasks** (research, design, writing, editing)
- Use **collaborative tools** (shared documents, project planning)
- Combine work into **final product**

Example projects: class podcast episode, digital magazine page, video documentary, interactive quiz

### 8. Using Simple Editing Tools
Practice with **basic editing** for {{media_type}}:
- **Text**: Formatting, adding headings, inserting images
- **Images**: Cropping, resizing, adding text
- **Video/Audio**: Cutting clips, adjusting volume, adding titles
- **Presentations**: Transitions, animations, layout

**Ethical Media Creation**:

1. **Copyright respect**: Don't use others' work without permission
2. **Proper attribution**: Always cite sources
3. **Fact-checking**: Verify information before sharing
4. **Privacy**: Don't share personal information or others' images without consent
5. **Accuracy**: Present information truthfully

**Digital Tools** (Age-Appropriate):
- Presentation: Google Slides, PowerPoint
- Writing: Google Docs, Word
- Images: Canva (free version), simple paint programs

**Content Creation Process**:

1. **Plan**: What will you create? For whom? What's the message?
2. **Research**: Gather information and sources
3. **Create**: Produce the content
4. **Review**: Check for errors, completeness, citations
5. **Revise**: Make improvements
6. **Publish/Present**: Share your work

**Important**: Focus on **clear communication** over fancy effects. Teach **responsible digital citizenship** through source citation. Encourage **creativity** while maintaining **accuracy**. Projects should be **age-appropriate** in length and complexity - simple is better than over-ambitious.
