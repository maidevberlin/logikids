# Grammar - Past Perfect and Future

Create grammar practice tasks focusing on Present Perfect tense and future forms (going to and will), helping students understand time relationships and appropriate usage.

## Task Variations

### 1. Present Perfect for Experiences
Practice using **Present Perfect** for life experiences:
- Form: **have/has + past participle**
- Use with: *ever*, *never*, *before*, *many times*
- Express experiences without specific time

| Question | Answer Examples |
|----------|----------------|
| Have you ever been to London? | Yes, I have. / No, I haven't. |
| Has she visited Paris? | Yes, she has been there twice. |
| Have they tried sushi? | No, they have never tried it. |

**Practice**: Complete sentences about {{topic}} using Present Perfect.

Example topics: travel experiences, foods tried, books read, activities done

### 2. Present Perfect for Recent Actions and Results
Use **Present Perfect** for actions just completed or with present results:
- With *just* (very recent): *I've just finished my homework.*
- With *already* (earlier than expected): *She's already eaten lunch.*
- With *yet* (in questions/negatives): *Have you done your homework yet?*

> Example context:
> **Situation**: You arrive at your friend's house.
> **Friend**: "Let's watch a movie!"
> **You**: "Great! I've just finished my homework, so I'm free."

### 3. Going-to Future for Plans and Intentions
Practice **going to** for planned future actions:
- Form: **am/is/are + going to + verb**
- Use for: plans already decided, intentions, predictions based on evidence

**Contrast Practice**:
- **Present Continuous** (arrangements with time/place): *I'm meeting Sarah at 3 PM.*
- **Going to** (intentions/plans): *I'm going to study harder this year.*

Example contexts: holiday plans, New Year's resolutions, project intentions, weekend activities

### 4. Will-Future for Predictions and Spontaneous Decisions
Use **will** for:
- **Predictions**: *It will rain tomorrow.* / *You'll love this book!*
- **Spontaneous decisions**: *"The phone's ringing." "I'll get it!"*
- **Offers**: *I'll help you with that.*
- **Promises**: *I'll call you later.*

| Situation | Response with Will |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "I'm thirsty." | "I'll get you some water." |
| "This bag is heavy." | "I'll carry it for you." |
| Weather forecast | It will be sunny tomorrow. |

### 5. Will vs. Going To
Compare and choose the appropriate future form for {{scenario}}:

**Going to**: *I'm going to visit my grandparents.* (already decided)
**Will**: *I think I'll visit my grandparents.* (deciding now)

**Going to**: *Look at those clouds! It's going to rain.* (evidence)
**Will**: *I think it will rain tomorrow.* (prediction/opinion)

### 6. Time Expressions with Present Perfect
Match **Present Perfect sentences** with correct time expressions:
- *for* (duration): *I've lived here for three years.*
- *since* (starting point): *I've known her since 2020.*
- *ever/never*: *Have you ever been to Spain?*
- *just/already/yet*: *I've just arrived.* / *She's already left.* / *Haven't you finished yet?*

**Practice Task**: Fill in the correct time expression in sentences about {{topic}}.

### 7. Tense Contrast Practice
Distinguish between **Simple Past** and **Present Perfect**:

| Simple Past | Present Perfect |
|-------------|----------------|
| Specific past time | Connection to present |
| *I visited London in 2020.* | *I have visited London.* (experience) |
| *When did you arrive?* | *Have you arrived yet?* |

**Exercise**: Choose the correct tense for sentences about {{context}}.

### 8. Future Time Expressions
Practice using **time expressions** with future forms:
- *tomorrow*, *next week*, *in two days*, *soon*, *later*
- *I'm going to travel next summer.*
- *They will arrive in an hour.*
- *We're going to start the project soon.*

**Sentence Building**: Create sentences about {{topic}} using different future time expressions.

Example topics: school schedule, vacation plans, birthday plans, project timeline

**Grammar Practice Types**:

1. **Gap-fill**: Complete sentences with correct form
2. **Sentence transformation**: Change tense while keeping meaning
3. **Error correction**: Find and fix mistakes
4. **Sentence building**: Create original sentences using structures
5. **Multiple choice**: Choose the correct form

**Important Notes**:

- **Present Perfect ≠ Simple Past**: Use Simple Past with specific time (*yesterday*, *last week*), Present Perfect without specific time or for present relevance
- **Irregular past participles**: Students need to learn these (been, done, seen, eaten, etc.)
- **Context matters**: The choice between tenses depends on the speaker's perspective and what they want to emphasize

**Task Design**: Use **meaningful contexts** rather than isolated sentences, provide **clear examples** before practice, include **authentic situations** students can relate to, and offer **guided discovery** to help students notice patterns and rules.
