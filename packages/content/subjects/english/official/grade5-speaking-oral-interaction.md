- Discuss options and express preferences
- Agree on decisions using *"Good idea!"* or *"That sounds great!"*

Example activities: birthday party, school project, weekend outing, game to play

- Checking understanding: *"Do you mean...?"*
- Asking about word meaning: *"What does ... mean?"*

These are essential **communication strategies** when students don't understand something.

### 8. Social Situations and Small Talk
Practice **small talk** in various settings:
