# Vocabulary - Extended Themes

Create tasks that expand vocabulary across broader themes, teach text-type specific language, and develop use of sophisticated connectives for mature communication.

## Task Variations

### 1. Thematic Vocabulary Expansion
Build vocabulary around **broader themes** in {{topic_area}}:
- Learn **20-30 related words**
- Understand **word relationships** (synonyms, antonyms, word families)
- Practice in **varied contexts**
- Use in **productive tasks** (speaking, writing)

| Theme Area | Example Vocabulary |
|------------|-------------------|
| Environment | pollution, renewable, sustainable, climate, ecosystem, conservation |
| Technology | digital, device, software, internet, download, connect, virtual |

- **Values**: responsibility, fairness, kindness, independence

**Practice**: Discuss situations where these concepts are important, write examples, give definitions.

### 3. Text-Type Specific Language
Learn appropriate language for **different text types**:

**Formal Emails/Letters**:
- *Dear Sir/Madam*, *I am writing to...*,  *I would like to request...*,*Thank you for your consideration*, *Yours sincerely*

**Informal Messages**:
- *Hey!*, *How's it going?*, *Thanks so much!*, *See you soon!*, *Catch you later*

**Reports**:

**Stories**:
- *Once upon a time*, *Suddenly...*, *Meanwhile...*, *In the end...*

**Task**: Write the same basic message in different styles for different audiences.

### 4. Advanced Connectives and Discourse Markers
Practice using **sophisticated connectives** to link ideas:

| Purpose | Connectives | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Adding | furthermore, moreover, in addition | "I enjoy reading. *Furthermore*, it improves my English." |
| Contrasting | however, nevertheless, although, whereas | "*Although* it was raining, we went out." |
| Cause/Effect | therefore, consequently, as a result | "I studied hard. *Therefore*, I passed the test." |
| Sequencing | firstly, subsequently, finally | "*Firstly*, mix the ingredients. *Then*, bake for 30 minutes." |
| Examples | for instance, such as, for example | "I enjoy sports, *for instance*, basketball and tennis." |

### 5. Collocations and Fixed Expressions
Learn **word combinations** that commonly go together:

**Verb + Noun**:
- *make* a decision, *do* homework, *take* a photo, *give* advice, *have* fun

**Adjective + Noun**:

**Verb + Preposition**:

**Math**: calculate, measure, estimate, solve, equation, formula
**Literature**: character, theme, plot, setting, author, genre
**History**: century, decade, ancient, modern, civilization, event

**Task**: Read a simple academic text about {{topic}} and identify key academic vocabulary.

### 7. Phrasal Verbs (Common Ones)
Introduce **high-frequency phrasal verbs**:

| Phrasal Verb | Meaning | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| look after | take care of | "I look after my little sister." |
| find out | discover | "Let's find out the answer." |
| give up | stop trying | "Don't give up! Keep practicing." |
| turn off/on | stop/start a device | "Please turn off the lights." |
| pick up | collect, learn | "I'll pick you up at 3 PM." |
| put on | wear | "Put on your coat, it's cold." |

**Important**: Start with **literal meanings** and most common uses before teaching multiple meanings.

### 8. Register and Formality
Understand **levels of formality** and when to use each:

| Situation | Formal | Neutral | Informal |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|
| Greeting | Good morning | Hello | Hi / Hey |
| Farewell | Goodbye | Bye | See ya |
| Thanking | Thank you very much | Thanks | Thanks! |
| Requesting | Would you mind...? | Can you please...? | Can you...? |
| Apologizing | I apologize | I'm sorry | Sorry |

**Task**: Identify the register in different texts, rewrite sentences in different formality levels.

**Vocabulary Learning Strategies**:

1. **Contextual learning**: Learn words in phrases and sentences, not isolation
2. **Grouping**: Organize by theme, word family, or function
3. **Personal connection**: Use new words to talk about your own life
4. **Active use**: Don't just recognize - produce the words in speaking/writing
5. **Spaced repetition**: Review new words regularly over time
6. **Multiple exposures**: See/hear/use new words in various contexts

**Building Advanced Vocabulary**:

- **Read extensively**: Encounter words in natural contexts
- **Keep a vocabulary notebook**: Organize and review new words
- **Use new words immediately**: In conversation or writing
- **Learn word families**: If you know "create", learn "creation", "creative", "creativity"
- **Notice collocations**: Pay attention to what words go together

**Important**: Introduce **15-25 new words** per topic maximum for Grade 6. Focus on **high-frequency** and **useful** vocabulary students will actually encounter and use. Always teach vocabulary **in context**, not as isolated word lists. Practice through **varied activities** (matching, gap-fill, using in sentences, discussions). Emphasize **depth** (knowing a word well) over **breadth** (knowing many words superficially).
