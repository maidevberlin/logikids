example_tasks:
  - Combine two sentences using relative pronouns (who, which, that) to create one complex sentence
  - Complete sentences with appropriate quantifiers (some, any, much, many, a lot of)
  - Write comparative and superlative forms of adjectives in sentences about different topics
  - Join sentences using adverbial clauses with because, when, or if
real_world_context: Advanced sentence structures allow students to express complex ideas, describe people and things more precisely, make comparisons, explain reasons and conditions, and create more sophisticated written and spoken English. These structures make communication more precise and engaging.

# Grammar - Sentence Structures

Create grammar practice tasks focusing on relative clauses, adverbial clauses, comparative forms, and quantifiers to help students build more complex sentences.

## Task Variations

### 1. Relative Clauses with Who, Which, That
Practice combining sentences using **relative pronouns**:

| Relative Pronoun | Use | Example |
|-----------------|-----|---------|
| **who** | People | The girl *who* lives next door is my friend. |
| **which** | Things/animals | The book *which* I'm reading is exciting. |
| **that** | People/things | The movie *that* we watched was funny. |

**Exercise**: Combine sentences about {{topic}}:
- *I have a friend. She speaks three languages.* → *I have a friend who speaks three languages.*

Example topics: describing people, favorite things, places visited, animals

### 2. Defining Relative Clauses
Use relative clauses to **define or identify** something:
- *A library is a place where you can borrow books.*
- *A teacher is a person who helps students learn.*
- *Soccer is a sport that millions of people play.*

**Task**: Write definitions for {{category}} using relative clauses.

Example categories: professions, places in town, sports, school subjects, hobbies

### 3. Adverbial Clauses of Reason (because, since, as)
Practice expressing **reasons and causes**:
- *I stayed home **because** I was sick.*
- *We can't go outside **because** it's raining.*
- ***Since** it's your birthday, I bought you a present.*

> Example context:
> **Question**: Why are you learning English?
> **Answer**: I'm learning English *because* I want to travel the world.

**Practice**: Write sentences explaining reasons for {{situation}}.

Example situations: choices made, actions taken, feelings expressed, decisions explained

### 4. Adverbial Clauses of Time (when, while, before, after)
Use time clauses to show **when** things happen:
- *I'll call you **when** I arrive home.*
- ***While** I was reading, the phone rang.*
- ***Before** you leave, please turn off the lights.*
- ***After** we finish homework, we can play.*

**Time Relationship Practice**: Join sentences about {{topic}} using time connectors.

Example topics: daily routines, story sequences, instructions, event descriptions

### 5. Adverbial Clauses of Condition (if, unless)
Express **conditions** and possible results:
- ***If** it rains, we'll stay inside.*
- *I'll go to the party **if** my parents say yes.*
- *You won't pass **unless** you study.* (unless = if not)

| First Clause (Condition) | Second Clause (Result) |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| If you practice every day, | you will improve quickly. |
| If I have time tomorrow, | I'll help you with your project. |

### 6. Comparative and Superlative Adjectives
Practice comparing using **-er/-est** or **more/most**:

**Regular Patterns**:
| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| tall | taller | tallest |
| big | bigger | biggest |
| easy | easier | easiest |
| expensive | more expensive | most expensive |
| interesting | more interesting | most interesting |

**Irregular Forms**:
- good → better → best
- bad → worse → worst
- far → farther/further → farthest/furthest

**Exercise**: Write sentences comparing {{items}} using appropriate forms.

Example items: animals, cities, sports, school subjects, seasons

### 7. Using Quantifiers
Choose correct quantifiers for **countable** and **uncountable** nouns:

| Quantifier | Countable | Uncountable | Example |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **some** | ✓ | ✓ | some books, some water |
| **any** | ✓ | ✓ | any questions, any help |
| **many** | ✓ | ✗ | many students (*not* many water) |
| **much** | ✗ | ✓ | much time (*not* much books) |
| **a lot of** | ✓ | ✓ | a lot of friends, a lot of fun |
| **a few** | ✓ | ✗ | a few apples |
| **a little** | ✗ | ✓ | a little milk |

**Practice**: Fill in quantifiers in sentences about {{context}}.

Example contexts: shopping, food, time management, school supplies

### 8. Building Complex Sentences
Combine **multiple clauses** to create sophisticated sentences about {{topic}}:
- Use relative clauses for description
- Add adverbial clauses for reason, time, or condition
- Include comparisons when appropriate

> Example:
> *Simple*: I have a friend. She is very tall. She plays basketball. She is good at it.
> *Complex*: I have a friend **who** is very tall and plays basketball. She is much better at it **than** I am **because** she practices every day.

**Comparison Sentence Patterns**:
- *X is __er than Y*: *Math is harder than English for me.*
- *X is the __est*: *Summer is the best season.*
- *X is more __ than Y*: *This book is more interesting than that one.*
- *as __ as*: *I'm as tall as my brother.*

**Important Grammar Notes**:

- **Relative clause punctuation**: No commas in defining clauses (*The book that I bought is here.*)
- **Adverbial clause position**: Can go at start or end of sentence
- **If-clause tense**: Use present tense in if-clause, will in result clause (*If it rains, we will stay home.*)
- **Quantifier usage**: Some (positive/offers), any (negative/questions)

**Task Design**: Practice structures in **meaningful contexts**, not isolated sentences. Build gradually from **simple to complex**. Use topics students can relate to and care about. Provide **clear examples** before asking students to produce their own sentences.
