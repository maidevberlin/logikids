# Writing - Personal Correspondence

Create writing tasks where students produce personal correspondence with appropriate detail, tone, and organization for different audiences and purposes.

- Multiple **paragraphs** organized by topic
- **Specific details** (dates, times, descriptions)
- Personal **thoughts** and **questions**

| Email Part | Example Content |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Greeting | Dear Emma, / Hi Tom! |

- **Add** your own news or questions
- Match their **tone** (formal/informal)

> Example responsive writing:
> **Their message**: "I'm nervous about the school play. What if I forget my lines?"
> **Your response**: "I understand how you feel! I get nervous too before performances. Maybe we could practice together? I'm sure you'll do great - you've been rehearsing so much!"

Provide **models** and **frameworks** to support students in organizing their correspondence effectively.
