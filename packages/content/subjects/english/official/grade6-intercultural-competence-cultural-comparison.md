# Intercultural Competence - Cultural Comparison

Create tasks that help students compare cultures systematically, appreciate differences respectfully, recognize stereotypes, and develop multiple perspectives.

## Task Variations

### 1. Systematic Cultural Comparison
Compare {{aspect}} between Germany and {{English_speaking_country}}:
- Identify **similarities** and **differences**
- Describe **both cultures** respectfully
- Avoid judging one as "better" or "worse"
- Use **comparative language** appropriately

| Aspect to Compare | Example Questions |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Celebrations | How do people celebrate birthdays/holidays? |
| School life | What's similar and different about school? |
| Food culture | What are typical meals? When do people eat? |
| Greetings | How do people greet each other? |
| Sports & hobbies | What activities are popular? |

Example countries: USA, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland

### 2. Understanding Cultural Perspectives
Present a **situation** and explore how people from {{culture_a}} and {{culture_b}} might view it:
- Explain what each perspective values
- Show understanding of **why** differences exist
- Demonstrate **respect** for both viewpoints
- Avoid claiming one is "right"

> Example situation:
> **Topic**: Personal space and physical contact in greetings
> **German perspective**: Handshakes are common; personal space is valued
> **Some other cultures**: Hugs, kisses on cheeks, or no physical contact may be normal
> **Understanding**: Different cultures have different comfort levels with touch and proximity

### 3. Stereotype Recognition and Critical Thinking
Examine **statements about cultural groups** and determine:
- Which are **stereotypes** (oversimplified, often inaccurate generalizations)
- Which are **facts** (verifiable, accurate information)
- Why stereotypes can be harmful
- How to respectfully talk about cultural patterns without stereotyping

| Statement Type | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Stereotype | "All British people drink tea all day long." |
| Fact | "Tea is a popular beverage in the UK." |
| Stereotype | "Americans only eat fast food." |
| Fact | "Fast food is widely available in the USA." |

**Discussion**: Why is it important to avoid stereotypes?

### 4. Cultural Traditions and Celebrations
Research and compare **celebrations or traditions** for {{occasion}}:
- **Describe** how it's celebrated in different English-speaking countries
- Identify **common elements** across cultures
- Note **unique traditions** specific to each place
- Present information **respectfully** and **accurately**

Example occasions: New Year, birthdays, weddings, national holidays, coming-of-age celebrations

### 5. Daily Life Comparisons
Compare **aspects of daily life** in {{location_a}} and {{location_b}}:
- Typical school day schedule
- Common meals and eating times
- Transportation methods
- Family structures and living situations
- Weekend activities

Create a **comparison table** or **Venn diagram** showing similarities in the middle and differences on the sides.

### 6. Language and Communication Styles
Explore how **communication patterns** differ across cultures:
- **Directness** vs. indirectness in communication
- **Formality** levels (addressing adults, teachers, strangers)
- **Gestures** and their meanings
- **Polite expressions** and when to use them

> Example:
> In some English-speaking cultures, being very direct is valued. In others, indirect communication shows respect. Neither is wrong - they're just different cultural patterns.

### 7. Cultural Values and Priorities
Identify and compare **what different cultures value**:
- Individual achievement vs. group harmony
- Punctuality and time management
- Work-life balance
- Education priorities
- Environmental practices

**Activity**: Read short texts about {{topic}} in different cultures and identify the underlying values.

Example topics: attitudes toward time, importance of family, views on success

### 8. Avoiding Cultural Misunderstandings
Examine **scenarios** where cultural differences could cause misunderstandings:
- Explain what the misunderstanding might be
- Show **both perspectives**
- Suggest how to handle the situation respectfully
- Practice **cultural sensitivity**

> Scenario example:
> A German student visits an American friend. The friend's mother says, "You should come over for dinner sometime!" The German student waits for a specific invitation that never comes.
> **Understanding**: In some English-speaking cultures, this can be a polite but general statement, not always a specific invitation.

**Key Principles of Cultural Competence**:

1. **Respect**: All cultures have value and deserve respect
2. **Curiosity**: Ask questions and learn without judging
3. **Openness**: Be willing to see things from other perspectives
4. **Humility**: Recognize that your way isn't the only way
5. **Awareness**: Understand your own cultural background influences your views

**Important Vocabulary**:
- *culture*, *tradition*, *custom*, *value*, *perspective*, *diversity*, *stereotype*, *generalization*, *respect*, *tolerance*, *understanding*

**Task Design**: Use **authentic sources** when possible (interviews, videos, texts from the cultures being discussed). Encourage **respectful discussion** and **critical thinking**. Avoid presenting any culture as "exotic" or "strange." Help students see that **variation within** a culture is as important as variation **between** cultures - not all Germans are the same, and not all Americans are the same.
