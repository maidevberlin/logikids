# Mediation - Both Directions

Create a mediation task where students transfer information between German and English, adapting it appropriately for the audience and purpose.

## Task Variations

### 1. Event Information Transfer (German to English)
Provide a **German text** about {{event}} and ask students to:
- Extract the **most important information**
- Write a **simple English summary** for an English-speaking friend
- Include relevant details (**when, where, what, who**)

Example events: birthday party, sports tournament, school trip, festival

### 2. Announcement Mediation (English to German)
Present an **English announcement** about {{topic}} and have students:
- Identify the **key message**
- Explain the information **in German** for someone who doesn't understand English
- Convey the **essential details** clearly

Example topics: schedule change, weather warning, lost item, event cancellation

### 3. Instructions Translation
Give **instructions in one language** for {{activity}} and ask students to:
- Understand the **steps** and **purpose**
- Explain the instructions **in the other language**
- Ensure the explanation is **clear and complete**

| Direction | Example Task |
|-----------|--------------|
| German → English | Recipe steps, game rules, craft instructions |
| English → German | App tutorial, safety rules, assembly guide |

### 4. Menu or Shopping Information
Provide a **menu** or **product list** in {{source_language}} and have students:
- Identify items that would interest the person asking
- Translate **key terms** and descriptions
- Answer simple questions about prices or ingredients

Example contexts: restaurant menu, grocery store, souvenir shop, online catalog

### 5. Email or Message Summary
Present an **email or text message** in one language about {{topic}} and ask students to:
- Summarize the **main points** in the other language
- Include **important details** (dates, times, requests)
- Adapt the **tone** appropriately for the recipient

Example topics: invitation, confirmation, information request, friendly update

### 6. Tourist Information Mediation
Provide **tourist information** (brochure, sign, announcement) in {{language}} and have students:
- Extract information relevant to {{purpose}}
- Explain it clearly in the other language
- Focus on practical details the person needs

Example purposes: finding directions, understanding opening hours, learning about attractions, reading safety rules

### 7. School-Home Communication
Present a **school communication** (German) and ask students to:
- Explain the content **in English** as if telling a pen pal about it
- OR: Receive **English information** and explain it to German-speaking family

Example content: field trip permission slip, homework assignment, achievement certificate, report card comment

### 8. Social Media or Forum Posts
Show a **short post or comment** in one language about {{topic}} and have students:
- Convey the **main idea** in the other language
- Capture the **meaning** rather than translating word-for-word
- Adapt to the **context** and **audience**

Example topics: sports results, hobby tips, book recommendation, local news

**Important Mediation Principles**:

> **Not Word-for-Word Translation**: Students should focus on conveying the meaning and important information, not translating every word.

> **Audience Awareness**: Consider who needs the information and what they need to know.

> **Appropriate Detail Level**: Include enough detail to be useful, but avoid overwhelming with unnecessary information.

**Task Design**: Provide realistic scenarios where mediation serves a genuine purpose - helping someone understand something they otherwise couldn't access. The difficulty should be appropriate for Grade 5, with familiar vocabulary and clear contexts.
