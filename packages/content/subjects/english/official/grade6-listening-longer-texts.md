# Listening - Longer Texts

Create listening comprehension tasks for structured texts (2-4 minutes), helping students follow main points, understand details, and make predictions.

## Task Variations

### 1. Extended Conversations (Multiple Speakers)
Present a **conversation** between {{number}} people about {{topic}}:
- Identify each **speaker's viewpoint** or role
- Follow the **development** of the conversation
- Understand **agreements** and **disagreements**
- Note **decisions** or **conclusions** reached

Example topics: planning a school project, discussing weekend plans, problem-solving together, family discussion

> **Listening Strategy**: Pay attention to different voices and who says what. Note how the conversation develops and changes.

### 2. Short Podcast or Radio Segment
Provide a **podcast episode** or **radio show** segment about {{topic}}:
- Identify the **main topic** and **purpose**
- Follow the **structure** (introduction, main points, conclusion)
- Extract **key information** and **supporting details**
- Distinguish between **main ideas** and **examples**

Example topics: interesting facts about nature, sports updates, book recommendations, science explanations, cultural topics

### 3. Educational Video or Documentary Segment
Play a **short documentary** or **educational video** about {{subject}}:
- Take **notes** on important information
- Organize information by **categories** or **themes**
- Answer specific comprehension questions
- Summarize the **main message**

| Note-Taking Strategy | What to Write |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Main topic | What is this about? |
| Key facts | Important information, numbers, names |
| Categories | Group related information together |
| New vocabulary | Words to look up or remember |

### 4. Story or Narrative (Longer)
Listen to a **story** or **personal narrative** ({{genre}}) lasting 2-3 minutes:
- Follow the **plot** development
- Understand **character** motivations and feelings
- Identify **problems** and **solutions**
- Predict **what will happen** and adjust predictions

Example genres: adventure story, mystery, personal experience, historical tale, fantasy

### 5. Prediction and Adjustment
Use **staged listening** with pause points:
- **Before listening**: Predict based on title/introduction
- **During listening**: Confirm or adjust predictions
- **After each section**: Think about what might come next
- **End**: Reflect on which predictions were correct

> Example activity:
> 1. Listen to the title and first 30 seconds - What do you think this will be about?
> 2. Pause - What has happened so far? What might happen next?
> 3. Continue listening and checking predictions

### 6. Instructions or Procedures (Extended)
Follow **multi-step instructions** or **process explanations** for {{activity}}:
- Understand the **sequence** of steps
- Note **important details** (timing, quantities, warnings)
- Remember **order** of operations
- Identify **purpose** of each step

Example activities: science experiment, recipe, craft project, how something works, game rules

### 7. Structured Presentations or Talks
Listen to a **short presentation** about {{topic}}:
- Identify the **organization pattern** (problem-solution, compare-contrast, chronological)
- Note **transition signals** (first, next, however, in conclusion)
- Extract **key points** from each section
- Understand the **speaker's purpose** (inform, persuade, entertain)

Example topics: book report, travel presentation, research on an animal, explanation of a hobby

### 8. News Reports or Announcements
Understand **news-style reporting** about {{event}}:
- Answer the **5 W's** (Who, What, When, Where, Why)
- Distinguish **facts** from **opinions** (if appropriate)
- Understand **cause and effect** relationships
- Follow **chronological** or **logical** sequence

Example events: school event, sports result, community news, weather update, special announcement

**Active Listening Strategies**:

1. **Pre-listening**: Think about what you know about the topic
2. **While listening**:
   - Focus on main ideas first, details second
   - Take simple notes if allowed
   - Visualize what you hear
   - Connect to what you already know
3. **Post-listening**: Summarize mentally or in writing

**Dealing with Longer Texts**:

- Don't panic if you miss something - keep listening
- Focus on understanding the **gist** before worrying about every word
- Use **context** to guess meaning of unknown words
- Notice **signpost words** that show structure (first, however, finally, etc.)

**Task Design**: Use **authentic-sounding** or **authentic** materials when possible. Provide **scaffolding** (vocabulary pre-teaching, context-setting) for challenging texts. Include **varied question types** (multiple choice, true/false, short answer, note-taking). Allow for **multiple listenings** - this is about comprehension, not memory. Texts should be **clearly structured** with logical organization, spoken at **normal** but **clear speed**, and on **age-appropriate** topics with **familiar vocabulary** plus some new words inferable from context.
