# Speaking - Coherent Presentations

Create speaking tasks where students deliver organized, fluent presentations with clear structure, logical flow, and supporting details.

## Task Variations

### 1. Structured Presentations with Clear Organization
Prepare and deliver a **presentation** (2-3 minutes) about {{topic}} with:
- **Introduction**: Greet audience, state topic, preview main points
- **Body**: 2-3 main points with supporting details
- **Conclusion**: Summarize, final thought, thank audience

| Presentation Part | Example Language |
|------------------|------------------|
| Introduction | "Today I'm going to talk about... I'll cover three main points..." |
| Transitions | "First...", "Next...", "Moving on to...", "Finally..." |
| Conclusion | "To sum up...", "In conclusion...", "Thank you for listening." |

Example topics: favorite hobby, interesting animal, historical figure, dream vacation, book review

### 2. Explanatory Presentations (How Something Works)
Explain {{process}} or {{system}} clearly and logically:
- State what it **is** first
- Explain the **main components** or **steps**
- Show **how parts work together**
- Use **examples** to clarify
- Check for understanding

Example topics: how photosynthesis works, how to bake a cake, how bicycles work, how solar panels generate energy

> **Useful Phrases**:
> - "Let me explain how this works..."
> - "There are three main parts..."
> - "First, ..., then ..., and finally..."
> - "For example..."

### 3. Opinion Presentations with Justification
Present your **opinion on {{topic}}** with:
- **Clear thesis**: State your position
- **Multiple reasons** (2-3): Support with explanations
- **Examples or evidence**: Make reasons concrete
- **Counter-argument** (optional): Address other views
- **Strong conclusion**: Restate opinion

**Structure Template**:
1. Opinion statement: "I believe that..."
2. First reason: "One reason is... For example..."
3. Second reason: "Another important point is..."
4. Third reason (optional): "Finally..."
5. Conclusion: "For all these reasons, I think..."

Example topics: best way to protect environment, importance of learning English, benefits of reading, ideal pet

### 4. Problem-Solution Presentations
Present a **problem** and propose **solutions** for {{situation}}:
- **Describe the problem** clearly
- Explain **why it matters**
- Present **2-3 possible solutions**
- Explain **pros and cons** of each (if appropriate)
- Recommend the **best solution** with reasons

Example situations: reducing plastic waste, improving school library, helping endangered animals, managing homework time

### 5. Compare-and-Contrast Presentations
Compare **two subjects** ({{item_a}} vs {{item_b}}):
- Introduce both subjects briefly
- Discuss **similarities**
- Discuss **differences**
- State **preference** or **conclusion** (if appropriate)

| Organization Method | How to Structure |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Block method | Talk about A completely, then B completely |
| Point-by-point | Compare on one aspect, then another, then another |

Example comparisons: two seasons, two sports, two books, two countries, cats vs. dogs

### 6. Descriptive Reports
Give a **structured description** or **report** on {{subject}}:
- Organize information into **categories** or **aspects**
- Provide **specific details** for each aspect
- Use **descriptive language**
- Follow a **logical order** (general to specific, or by importance)

Example subjects: describe your town, report on an animal's habitat and behavior, describe a historical event, report on a science experiment

### 7. Book/Film Review Presentations
Present a **review** of {{book_or_film}}:
- **Introduction**: Title, author/director, genre, brief summary (no spoilers!)
- **Main points**: What's good/interesting, what could be better
- **Personal opinion**: Your rating and recommendation
- **Conclusion**: Who would enjoy it

**Avoid**: Giving away the ending or major plot twists!

### 8. Using Visual Aids
Enhance presentations with **simple visual supports**:
- **Posters**: Key points, images
- **Objects**: Show and explain
- **Slides**: Bullet points, pictures (if available)
- **Charts/Diagrams**: Organize information visually

**Rule**: Visuals should **support**, not replace, speaking. Don't read directly from slides.

**Presentation Skills**:

**Voice**:
- Speak **clearly** and at a **moderate pace**
- Use appropriate **volume** (loud enough for all to hear)
- Vary **intonation** (don't speak in monotone)
- **Pause** between main points

**Body Language**:
- **Stand** confidently
- Make **eye contact** with audience
- Use **gestures** naturally
- **Avoid**: Reading from notes constantly, fidgeting, turning back to audience

**Organization**:
- Have clear **beginning, middle, end**
- Use **transition words** (first, next, however, in conclusion)
- **Signpost**: Tell audience where you are in the presentation
- Stick to **time limits**

**Preparation Tips**:

1. **Plan**: Outline main points
2. **Research**: Gather information
3. **Organize**: Arrange in logical order
4. **Practice**: Rehearse multiple times
5. **Time**: Check you're within time limit
6. **Prepare notes**: Key words only, not full sentences
7. **Anticipate questions**: Think what audience might ask

**Dealing with Nerves**:
- **Practice** thoroughly - confidence comes from preparation
- **Breathe** deeply before starting
- **Focus** on your message, not on being perfect
- Remember: Audience wants you to succeed!

**Important**: Presentations should be **2-3 minutes** for Grade 6 level, on **familiar topics** students know about or have researched, with **clear structure** emphasized over perfect grammar, allowing **notes** but not reading word-for-word, and focusing on **communication** and **confidence building**.
