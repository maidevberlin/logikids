# Writing - Written Interaction

Create writing tasks where students interact in written form, exchanging information and responding appropriately to correspondence.

## Task Variations

### 1. Responding to Invitations
Provide an **invitation** to {{event}} and have students write a **reply**:
- Thank the person for the invitation
- **Accept** or **decline** clearly
- Give a **reason** if declining
- Express enthusiasm if accepting

Example events: birthday party, playdate, school event, sleepover

> Example invitation format:
> *"You're invited to my birthday party on Saturday at 3 PM. We'll have games and cake! Can you come?"*

### 2. Thank-You Notes and Cards
Students write a **thank-you note** for {{gift_or_help}}:
- Address the person appropriately (*Dear...*)
- **Thank them specifically** for what they did/gave
- Say **why you appreciate it** or **how you'll use it**
- Close with an appropriate phrase (*Love,* *Your friend,*)

| Situation | Example Opening |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Gift received | Thank you so much for the wonderful... |
| Help given | I really appreciate your help with... |
| Hospitality | Thank you for having me over... |

### 3. Short Messages and Notes
Write **brief messages** for {{purpose}}:

### 4. Email Exchanges

### 5. Postcard Writing
Write a **postcard** from {{location}}:

- Share **interesting details** or experiences
- Ask the recipient a question
- Keep it **short** (postcard length)

> Example structure:

> *Greetings from the beach! The weather is amazing. Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw colorful fish. How are you? What are you doing this summer?*
> *Miss you!*
> *Alex"*

### 6. Social Media Messages/Posts

- **Turn-taking in writing**: Responding to what the other person wrote
- **Appropriate tone**: Matching formality to relationship and situation
- **Clear communication**: Making sure the message is understandable

| Closing | See you! / Bye! | Best wishes, / Sincerely, |
| Language | Casual, contractions | More complete sentences |

**Task Design**: Create realistic situations where students genuinely need to respond or exchange information. Provide a clear context and purpose for writing. Show example formats but encourage personalization.
