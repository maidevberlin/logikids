# Speaking - Oral Production

Create a speaking task where students produce extended speech, describing or presenting information on familiar topics.

## Task Variations

### 1. Describing People
Have students describe {{person}} including:
- **Physical appearance** (height, hair, eyes, clothing)
- **Personality traits** (kind, funny, quiet, energetic)
- **Interests or abilities**

Example people: family member, friend, favorite celebrity, fictional character

| Aspect | Example Language |
|--------|------------------|
| Appearance | She has long brown hair... / He's tall and... |
| Personality | She's very friendly and... / He likes to... |
| Interests | His favorite hobby is... / She enjoys... |

### 2. Describing Places
Students describe {{place}} they know or have visited:
- **Location** and **size**
- **What you can see** there
- **Activities** you can do
- **Personal feelings** about the place

Example places: hometown, favorite park, dream destination, school, vacation spot

### 3. Describing Objects or Animals
Present a description of {{subject}}:
- **What it looks like** (color, size, shape)
- **What it does** or **how it's used**
- **Why it's interesting** or important

Example subjects: favorite toy, pet, wild animal, invention, sports equipment

### 4. Reporting on Events
Have students tell about {{event}} that happened:
- **When** and **where** it took place
- **Who** was involved
- **What happened** (in sequence)
- **How they felt** about it

Example events: birthday party, school trip, sports game, family celebration, weekend activity

### 5. Giving Opinions with Reasons
Students present their opinion on {{topic}}:
- State their opinion clearly: *"I think..."* / *"In my opinion..."*
- Give **2-3 simple reasons**
- Use connecting words: *because*, *and*, *also*

Example topics: best season, favorite subject, ideal pet, best sport, preferred food

> Example structure:
> "I think summer is the best season. First, it's warm and sunny. Second, we have long holidays. Also, I can go swimming every day."

### 6. Short Prepared Presentations
Students prepare and deliver a **1-2 minute talk** about {{topic}}:
- Organize information with a **clear structure** (beginning, middle, end)
- Use simple **visual aids** if helpful
- Practice beforehand for **fluency**

Example topics: my hobby, interesting animal, favorite book, special place, family tradition

### 7. Storytelling
Students retell {{story}} or tell an original story:
- Use **past tense** appropriately
- Include **time sequencers** (first, then, after that, finally)
- Describe **characters**, **setting**, and **events**

Example story types: fairy tale retelling, personal experience, what-I-did-yesterday, fictional adventure

### 8. Show and Tell
Students bring {{item}} and present about it:
- Describe what it **is** and what it **looks like**
- Explain **where it came from** or **why it's special**
- Share **why they chose** to present it

Example items: souvenir, favorite book, collection item, handmade object, photograph

**Speaking Strategies to Practice**:

- **Planning**: Thinking about what to say before speaking
- **Using familiar language**: Sticking to words and structures they know
- **Self-correction**: Fixing mistakes when they notice them
- **Pausing appropriately**: Taking time to think without long silences

**Task Design Tips**: Provide preparation time, offer optional sentence starters or vocabulary lists, encourage (but don't require) visual aids, focus on communication rather than perfect grammar, and allow topics that students care about.
