### 4. Vocabulary in Context
Provide short texts about {{topic}} that use **topic-specific vocabulary**:

Example topics: a day at the beach, preparing for a party, visiting a museum, playing a sport

### 5. Word Families and Collocations

- **Nouns, verbs, adjectives** from the same word family
- **Common phrases** and **collocations**
- **Usage patterns** in sentences

> Example word family:

**Vocabulary Learning Strategies**:
