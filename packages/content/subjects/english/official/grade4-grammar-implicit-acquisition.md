# Grammar - Implicit Acquisition

Create tasks that help students acquire basic grammar patterns naturally through meaningful, contextualized use.

**Task Requirements:**
- NO explicit grammar explanations or metalanguage
- Focus on pattern recognition and natural use
- Embed grammar in engaging, meaningful contexts
- Use visual support (pictures, diagrams)
- Provide examples through stories and dialogues
- Make grammar practice feel like communication
- Cover: can/can't, singular/plural, possessive adjectives, basic sentence structures
- Age-appropriate for 9-10 year olds

**Generate varied task types:**

## Variation 1: Can/Can't Abilities Game
Present situations where students practice can/can't through real-world contexts.

**Example:**
Look at what these children can and can't do. Complete the sentences:

1. Sarah goes to swimming lessons every week.
   → She _____ swim very well. (*can*)

2. Tom has never played the piano before.
   → He _____ play the piano. (*can't*)

3. Emma practices football every day.
   → She _____ play football. (*can*)

4. My little brother is only 2 years old.
   → He _____ read books. (*can't*)

Then write about yourself: "I can _____ but I can't _____."

## Variation 2: Possessive Adjectives in Context
Use possessive adjectives naturally in stories about families and friends.

**Example:**
Complete the story with the correct word (*my, your, his, her*):

> Hi! _____ name is Tom. I have a sister. _____ name is Emma. We have a dog. _____ name is Max. Emma loves _____ dog very much. What's _____ name? Do you have a pet?

Fill in the blanks based on context clues.

## Variation 3: Singular/Plural Pattern Matching
Practice singular and plural forms through categorization without explicit rules.

**Example:**
Sort these into two groups:

*one cat, two dogs, a book, three pencils, my friend, their friends, this apple, those apples*

| One Thing | More Than One |
|-----------|---------------|
| _____ | _____ |
| _____ | _____ |

Then complete:
- I have one _____. (cat)
- I have two _____. (cats)
- This is my _____. (book)
- These are my _____. (books)

## Variation 4: Sentence Building Blocks
Build sentences by arranging word blocks in the correct order.

**Example:**
Put the words in the correct order:

1. [ can / I / swim / well ]
   → _____

2. [ has / She / a / dog ]
   → _____

3. [ play / They / football / can't ]
   → _____

4. [ is / His / blue / bike ]
   → _____

5. [ like / don't / We / pizza ]
   → _____

## Variation 5: Question and Answer Pairs
Practice question formation and responses naturally through conversations.

**Example:**
Match the questions to the answers:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| 1. Can you play the guitar? | A. Yes, she can. She loves swimming! |
| 2. Can your brother cook? | B. No, I can't. But I want to learn. |
| 3. Can Emma swim? | C. No, he can't. He's only 8 years old. |
| 4. Can they speak English? | D. Yes, they can. They're from London. |

Then write your own: "Can you _____? Yes, I can. / No, I can't."

## Variation 6: This/That/These/Those Picture Task
Use demonstratives naturally by referring to near and far objects.

**Example:**
Look at the picture. Complete the sentences:

(Near objects: a book, some pencils)
(Far objects: a bag, some chairs)

1. _____ is my book. (near) → *This*
2. _____ are my pencils. (near) → *These*
3. _____ is my bag. (far) → *That*
4. _____ are the chairs. (far) → *Those*

## Variation 7: Present Simple in Daily Routines
Practice present simple verb forms through daily routine descriptions.

**Example:**
Complete the text about Emma's day:

> Emma _____ (wake up) at 7 o'clock every day. She _____ (brush) her teeth and _____ (eat) breakfast. Then she _____ (go) to school. At school, she _____ (study) English and Maths. After school, she _____ (play) with her friends. In the evening, Emma _____ (do) her homework and _____ (watch) TV.

Word bank: *wakes up, brushes, eats, goes, studies, plays, does, watches*

Notice the pattern without explaining it.

## Variation 8: Have/Has Practice in Context
Use have/has naturally when talking about possessions and characteristics.

**Example:**
Complete with *have* or *has*:

1. I _____ a dog.
2. She _____ a cat.
3. They _____ three bikes.
4. Tom _____ blue eyes.
5. We _____ a big garden.
6. My sister _____ long hair.
7. You _____ a nice smile.

Then describe: "I _____ _____. My friend _____ _____."

## Variation 9: Negatives in Natural Contexts
Practice negative forms through likes/dislikes and abilities.

**Example:**
What do these children like? Complete the sentences:

1. Sarah loves chocolate.
   → She _____ vegetables. (*doesn't like*)

2. Tom plays football every day.
   → He _____ basketball. (*doesn't play*)

3. Emma can swim.
   → But she _____ dive. (*can't*)

4. We like summer.
   → We _____ winter. (*don't like*)

## Variation 10: Subject Pronouns in Story Completion
Replace names with pronouns naturally in continuing stories.

**Example:**
Read about Tom and Emma. Then complete the second part with *he, she, they, it*:

> Tom and Emma are friends. Tom likes football. Emma likes reading.

Continue:
> _____ play together every day. _____ is very good at sports. _____ loves books. _____ have a lot of fun together!

Replace:
- Tom → *he*
- Emma → *she*
- Tom and Emma → *they*
- the book → *it*
