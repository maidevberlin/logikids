# Speaking - Spontaneous Conversation

Create tasks that develop students' ability to participate in unscripted, natural conversations on familiar topics with fluency and detail.

## Task Variations

### 1. Opinion Exchange and Discussion
Discuss {{topic}} spontaneously with a partner:
- Express your **opinion** clearly
- Give **reasons** for your view
- **Listen** to and respond to others' opinions
- **Agree** or **disagree** politely
- Build on what others say

| Conversation Skill | Example Language |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Expressing opinion | "I think...", "In my opinion...", "I believe..." |
| Agreeing | "I agree because...", "That's a good point...", "Exactly!" |
| Disagreeing politely | "I see what you mean, but...", "I'm not sure about that..." |
| Adding to discussion | "Also...", "Another thing is...", "What about...?" |

Example topics: best season, school uniforms, importance of sports, pets vs. no pets, technology in schools

### 2. Detailed Information Exchange
Have a conversation exchanging **detailed information** about {{situation}}:
- Ask **follow-up questions** to get more details
- Provide **specific information** (times, places, descriptions)
- Clarify when needed
- Show interest in what the other person says

Example situations: weekend plans, recent trip, favorite book/movie, hobby or interest, school project

> Example exchange:
> A: "What are you doing this weekend?"
> B: "I'm going to visit my grandparents in Hamburg."
> A: "That sounds nice! How long will you stay?"
> B: "Just Saturday and Sunday. We're going to the zoo on Saturday."
> A: "Cool! Which zoo? Have you been there before?"

### 3. Problem-Solving Conversations
Discuss a **scenario or problem** ({{situation}}) and work toward a solution:
- Understand the problem together
- Suggest **possible solutions**
- Discuss **pros and cons**
- Make a **decision** collaboratively

Example situations: planning a class party on a budget, choosing a topic for a group project, deciding what to do on a rainy day, figuring out a schedule conflict

### 4. Storytelling and Sharing Experiences
Take turns telling about {{experience}} without preparation:
- Share details spontaneously as you remember them
- Answer questions about your story
- Show interest in others' stories
- Ask relevant follow-up questions

Example experiences: funny thing that happened, memorable vacation day, learning something new, meeting someone interesting

### 5. Debate-Style Discussion (Simple)
Participate in a **friendly debate** about {{topic}}:
- Take a **position** (pro or con)
- Present **arguments** spontaneously
- Respond to **counter-arguments**
- Use **polite disagreement**
- Stay **on topic**

**Structure**: Not formal debating - more like discussing different sides of an issue

Example topics: Should students have homework? Is summer better than winter? Are books better than movies?

### 6. Asking and Answering Detailed Questions
Practice **information interviews** about {{topic}}:
- Ask **open-ended questions** (not just yes/no)
- Give **detailed answers** with examples
- Ask **follow-up questions** based on answers
- Keep the conversation flowing naturally

| Question Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Open-ended | "What do you like to do in your free time?" |
| Follow-up | "Why do you enjoy that so much?" |
| Specific detail | "When did you start doing that?" |
| Opinion | "What's the best thing about it?" |

### 7. Reacting and Responding Naturally
Practice **natural reactions** and **responses** in conversation:
- Show **surprise**: "Really?", "Wow!", "That's amazing!"
- Express **interest**: "Tell me more!", "What happened next?"
- Show **empathy**: "That must have been difficult", "I understand how you feel"
- **Encourage** the speaker: "Uh-huh", "I see", "Go on..."

**Task**: Have a conversation about {{topic}} focusing on natural reactions and keeping the conversation flowing.

### 8. Handling Unexpected Questions
Practice responding when you don't have a prepared answer:
- **Take time to think**: "That's a good question. Let me think..."
- **Clarify** if needed: "Could you explain what you mean?"
- **Answer honestly**: "I'm not sure, but I think..."
- **Keep talking**: Don't give one-word answers

**Conversation Strategies**:

- **Extending answers**: Add examples, reasons, or related information
- **Turn-taking**: Know when to talk and when to listen
- **Topic maintenance**: Stay on topic but allow natural shifts
- **Repair**: Fix misunderstandings ("Oh, I meant...", "Sorry, I didn't explain that well")
- **Fillers** (use sparingly): "well", "um", "let me see" - give you time to think

**Making Conversations Flow**:

1. **Active listening**: Really pay attention to what the other person says
2. **Build on ideas**: Connect your contribution to what was just said
3. **Ask questions**: Show interest and keep conversation going
4. **Share the floor**: Don't dominate or stay silent
5. **Be responsive**: React naturally to what you hear

**Conversational English Features**:

- **Contractions**: I'm, don't, can't (more natural in conversation)
- **Informal language**: "kids" instead of "children", "stuff" instead of "things"
- **Short forms**: "Thanks" instead of "Thank you very much"
- **Casual phrases**: "you know", "I mean", "kind of"

**Dealing with Difficulties**:

- **Don't know a word**: Describe it instead, use a similar word, ask for help
- **Don't understand**: Ask for repetition or clarification
- **Need time**: Use fillers naturally while thinking
- **Make mistakes**: Don't panic - focus on communication, not perfection

**Important**: Tasks should encourage **natural flow**, not scripted dialogues. Topics must be **familiar** and **age-appropriate** so students can speak without extensive preparation. Emphasis should be on **fluency** and **interaction**, with **accuracy** secondary. Provide **scaffolding** (useful phrases, example questions) but allow for **spontaneity** and **personalization**.
