# Grammar - Present Tenses

Create tasks that help students master Simple Present and Present Progressive and understand when to use each.

**Task Requirements:**
- Contrast Simple Present (habits, facts, routines) with Present Progressive (actions happening now)
- Use meaningful, real-world contexts
- Practice affirmative, negative, and question forms
- Focus on USAGE not grammar rules
- Make the differences clear through examples
- Include time markers (every day, now, at the moment, usually)
- Age-appropriate for 10-11 year olds

**Generate varied task types:**

## Variation 1: Now vs Always Picture Contrast
Use pictures to show the difference between habits and current actions.

**Example:**

**Picture 1:** Tom playing football (action happening NOW)
**Picture 2:** Tom's weekly schedule showing football on Saturdays

**Complete:**
1. Look at Picture 1: Tom _____ (play) football now.
   → Tom **is playing** football now.

2. Look at Picture 2: Tom _____ (play) football every Saturday.
   → Tom **plays** football every Saturday.

**Rule:** Use **-ing** form for NOW. Use simple form for ALWAYS/USUALLY/EVERY...

## Variation 2: Choose the Correct Form
Select the right tense based on context and time markers.

**Example:**

Choose Simple Present OR Present Progressive:

1. Sarah usually _____ (walk/is walking) to school.
   *Answer: walks* (habit - usually)

## Variation 3: What Do You Do vs What Are You Doing
Practice the difference through interviews.
