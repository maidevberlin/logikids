# Writing - Connected Texts

Create writing tasks where students produce multi-paragraph texts with clear organization, logical connections between ideas, and coherent structure.

## Task Variations

### 1. Multi-Paragraph Narratives
Write a **connected story** (3-4 paragraphs) about {{topic}}:
- **Paragraph 1**: Set the scene (who, where, when)
- **Paragraphs 2-3**: Develop the story (events in sequence)
- **Final paragraph**: Conclusion or resolution
- Use **connecting words** between paragraphs (Later, Then, Finally, After that)

Example topics: memorable day, exciting adventure, learning experience, overcoming a challenge

> **Paragraph transitions**:
> - *The next day...*, *A few hours later...*, *Meanwhile...*, *In the end...*

### 2. Descriptive Essays (Multi-Paragraph)
Describe {{subject}} in organized paragraphs:
- **Introduction**: Present the subject
- **Body paragraphs**: Each covers one aspect
- **Conclusion**: Final thoughts or summary

| Paragraph Structure | Content |
|--------------------|---------|
| Para 1: Introduction | What/who you're describing and why |
| Para 2: First aspect | Physical description OR main characteristic |
| Para 3: Second aspect | Activities/behaviors OR importance |
| Para 4: Conclusion | Personal feelings or final thoughts |

Example subjects: favorite place, interesting person, beloved pet, dream house

### 3. Short Reports (Factual Information)
Write an **informational report** (100-150 words) about {{topic}}:
- **Introduction paragraph**: What the report is about
- **Information paragraphs**: Organized by categories or aspects (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Conclusion**: Summary or interesting final fact
- Use **present tense** for general facts

Example topics: endangered animal, country profile, historical figure, how something works, cultural celebration

**Organization methods**:
- By category (habitat, diet, behavior)
- Chronological (early life, later life, legacy)
- Problem-solution (the issue, what's being done)

### 4. Opinion Essays with Multiple Reasons
Write an **opinion text** (3-4 paragraphs) on {{topic}}:
- **Introduction**: State your opinion clearly
- **Body paragraphs**: One reason per paragraph with explanation and examples
- **Conclusion**: Restate opinion and summarize reasons

> **Structure Example**:
> **Paragraph 1**: I believe that reading books is more enjoyable than watching movies.
> **Paragraph 2**: First reason - books let you imagine the characters your own way
> **Paragraph 3**: Second reason - books usually have more details and depth
> **Paragraph 4**: In conclusion, while movies are entertaining, books offer a richer experience.

Example topics: importance of sports, best way to learn, school uniforms yes/no, protecting environment

### 5. Recounts of Events (With Reasons and Explanations)
Write about {{event}} explaining **what happened** and **why**:
- Describe the **sequence of events**
- Explain **reasons** for actions or decisions
- Include **personal reactions** and **feelings**
- Organize chronologically with clear connections

Example events: school trip, birthday celebration, sports competition, family gathering

**Connecting words for chronology**: first, at the start, then, next, after that, meanwhile, finally, in the end

### 6. Comparing and Contrasting (Extended)
Write a **comparison text** (3-4 paragraphs) about {{subject_a}} vs {{subject_b}}:

**Block method**:
- Introduction
- All about Subject A
- All about Subject B
- Conclusion (similarities/differences/preference)

**Point-by-point method**:
- Introduction
- First point of comparison (both A and B)
- Second point of comparison (both A and B)
- Conclusion

Example comparisons: two seasons, city vs. countryside, two sports, then vs. now

### 7. Problem-Solution Texts
Write about {{problem}} in structured paragraphs:
- **Paragraph 1**: Describe the problem
- **Paragraph 2**: Explain why it's important
- **Paragraph 3**: Propose solution(s)
- **Paragraph 4**: Conclusion (why solution would work)

Example problems: too much plastic waste, not enough exercise, screen time issues, protecting endangered animals

### 8. Fictional Narratives with Dialogue
Write a **short story** (150-200 words) including:
- **Setting** and **character introduction**
- **Dialogue** to move story forward
- **Clear plot** (problem and resolution)
- **Descriptive language**

> **Dialogue formatting**:
> "I'm so excited for the trip!" said Emma.
> Tom replied, "Me too! When do we leave?"

**Paragraph Organization Skills**:

1. **Topic sentence**: Introduces the main idea of the paragraph

5. **Editing**: Fix grammar, spelling, punctuation (basic)
6. **Final draft**: Produce clean copy

**Cohesion Techniques**:

- **Pronouns**: Refer back to previously mentioned things (he, she, it, they, this, that)
- **Synonyms**: Vary vocabulary (dog → pet → animal)
- **Connecting words**: Link ideas between sentences
- **Parallel structure**: Use similar grammatical patterns
- **Logical order**: Arrange ideas so they make sense together

**Important**: Texts should be **100-200 words** for Grade 6 level, organized into **3-5 short paragraphs**, focused on **familiar topics**, emphasizing **organization** and **coherence** over perfect grammar, and using **simple connectors** appropriately. Provide **planning time** and **organizational frameworks** (outlines, paragraph templates) to support structure.
