# Writing - Written Production

Create writing tasks where students produce independent written texts on familiar topics, including descriptions, stories, and opinions.

## Task Variations

### 1. Simple Story Writing
Students write a **short story** about {{topic}}:
- Use **past tense** for completed events
- Include **time sequencers** (first, then, after that, finally)
- Describe **characters** and **setting** briefly
- Have a clear **beginning, middle, and end**

Example topics: a special day, an adventure, a surprise, meeting someone new, a problem solved

> Example opening:
> *"Last summer, I had an amazing adventure. It all started when my family and I visited the mountains..."*

### 2. Descriptive Paragraphs
Have students describe {{subject}} in a paragraph:
- Use **descriptive adjectives** and **specific details**
- Organize logically (e.g., top to bottom, inside to outside)
- Include **sensory details** when appropriate (what you see, hear, smell)

| Subject Type | What to Include |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Person | Appearance, personality, interests, why they're important |
| Place | Location, what's there, what you can do, your feelings about it |
| Animal | What it looks like, where it lives, what it does, interesting facts |
| Object | Appearance, purpose, why it's special or important |

### 3. Opinion Writing
Students write their opinion on {{topic}} with reasons:
- State opinion clearly: *"I think..."* / *"In my opinion..."*
- Give **2-3 supporting reasons**
- Use **connecting words** (because, first, also, finally)
- Conclude with a summary statement

Example topics: best pet, favorite season, ideal weekend activity, school subject preference, book vs. movie

### 4. Personal Recount/Diary Entry
Write about {{experience}} that happened:
- Use **first person** (I, we)
- Include **when** and **where** it happened
- Describe **what happened** in sequence
- Share **feelings** and **reactions**

Example experiences: last weekend, vacation day, birthday celebration, school trip, special event

### 5. How-To Instructions
Students write **simple instructions** for {{activity}}:
- List **materials needed** (if any)
- Use **imperative verbs** (Do this, Add that)
- Number or sequence the steps clearly
- Include helpful **tips** if relevant

Example activities: making a sandwich, playing a simple game, drawing something, making a craft

### 6. Imaginative/Creative Writing
Write a **creative text** about {{prompt}}:
- Use imagination and **original ideas**
- Include **descriptive language**
- Can be realistic or fantastical
- Focus on creativity rather than perfect accuracy

Example prompts: dream vacation, ideal day, if I could fly, my robot helper, living in the future

### 7. Simple Reports or Factual Texts
Write a **short factual text** about {{topic}}:
- Present **information** clearly
- Organize into **simple paragraphs** (can be just 2-3)
- Include **interesting facts**
- Use **present tense** for general truths

Example topics: favorite animal, a country, a sport, a historical figure, an invention

### 8. Comparison Texts
Students compare **two things** ({{subject_a}} vs {{subject_b}}):
- Describe **each one**
- Point out **similarities** and **differences**
- Express a **preference** if appropriate
- Use comparison language (*bigger than*, *both have*, *different from*)

Example comparisons: two seasons, two sports, two foods, two places, two hobbies

**Writing Structure Elements**:

- **Topic sentence**: Introducing the main idea
- **Supporting details**: Explaining or describing
- **Conclusion**: Wrapping up the text

**Useful Connecting Words**:
- **Sequencing**: first, then, next, after that, finally
- **Adding**: and, also, too, as well
- **Contrasting**: but, however, although
- **Explaining**: because, so, for example

**Writing Process Support**:

1. **Planning**: Brainstorming ideas, organizing thoughts
2. **Drafting**: Getting ideas on paper
3. **Reviewing**: Reading over and improving
4. **Editing**: Fixing errors (optional for Grade 5)

**Important**: Texts should be **50-100 words** for Grade 5 level, focus on **familiar topics** students can write about from experience or imagination, emphasize **communication** over perfect grammar, and encourage **creativity** and **personal voice**.
