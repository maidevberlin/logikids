# English

Teaching English language skills through practical, engaging tasks.

**Important**: Instructions/explanations use {{language}}, but English content appears in English.

## Content Types

**Use:**

- _Italic_ for vocabulary
- **Bold** for grammar points
- Tables for conjugations, vocabulary lists, comparisons
- Blockquotes for example sentences/dialogues
- IPA notation for pronunciation

**Avoid:** LaTeX, Mermaid, code blocks

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure content diversity across tasks:

- Use different vocabulary and word choices
- Vary sentence structures and grammatical examples
- Change the specific content (topics, characters, situations)
- Avoid repetitive example sentences
- Ensure fresh, engaging content each time
