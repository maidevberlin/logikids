name: Divisibility and Prime Numbers
description: Understanding divisibility rules, distinguishing prime and composite numbers, and working with factors
grade: 5
ages:
  - 10
  - 11
focus: Number Theory Basics
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Apply divisibility rules to determine whether numbers are divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10
  - Identify and generate prime numbers; factorize composite numbers into prime factors
  - Determine the greatest common divisor (ggT) and least common multiple (kgV) of numbers
  - Recognize and describe patterns in number sequences related to divisibility
real_world_context: Divisibility and prime numbers appear throughout everyday life - when arranging items into equal groups, determining if quantities can be shared fairly, finding common meeting schedules, or optimizing resources. Understanding divisibility helps solve practical problems like determining packaging sizes, creating equal teams, coordinating recurring events, or simplifying fractions. Prime numbers form the foundation for computer security, cryptography, and mathematical problem-solving. This concept bridges arithmetic thinking with algebraic pattern recognition.

age_guidelines:
  10:
    - Focus on smaller numbers (up to 100 for most tasks)
    - Emphasize simpler divisibility rules (2, 5, 10 first, then 3 and 9)
    - Use visual aids like factor trees or number grids
    - Limit prime number range to approximately 2-50
    - ggT and kgV tasks with small numbers (single-digit to low double-digit)
    - Provide step-by-step guidance in problem structure
    - Use concrete contexts (arranging objects, forming groups)
    - Questions may offer multiple-choice support
  11:
    - Extend to larger numbers (up to 1000 for some tasks)
    - Include all divisibility rules (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10)
    - Reduce scaffolding, expect more independent reasoning
    - Work with primes up to approximately 100
    - ggT and kgV with larger numbers or multiple values (3+ numbers)
    - Combine multiple concepts in single problems
    - More abstract reasoning without concrete contexts
    - Open-response questions requiring written explanations
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-step divisibility checks with obvious rules (2, 5, 10)
    - Small numbers (under 50) for prime identification
    - Factor finding for numbers with few factors
    - Prime factorization of simple composites (products of 2-3 small primes)
    - ggT and kgV of number pairs with obvious relationships
    - Visual support like factor trees or number charts provided
    - Clear, direct questions with minimal ambiguity
  medium:
    - Multi-step problems combining divisibility rules
    - Numbers 50-200 for prime identification and factorization
    - Divisibility rules requiring more calculation (3, 6, 9)
    - ggT and kgV requiring systematic method (listing or factorization)
    - Pattern recognition in sequences
    - Problems requiring explanation or justification
    - Mix of abstract and contextual scenarios
  hard:
    - Complex multi-step problems integrating multiple concepts
    - Large numbers (200-1000) requiring efficient strategies
    - All divisibility rules including compound rules (6 requires both 2 and 3)
    - ggT and kgV of three or more numbers
    - Prime factorization with larger composites or numbers with many factors
    - Problems requiring proof or counterexample reasoning
    - Abstract mathematical reasoning without scaffolding
    - Creating examples meeting specific criteria
