name: Divisibility and Prime Numbers
description: Applying divisibility rules for 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10, identifying prime and composite numbers, performing prime factorization using factor trees, and determining GCD and LCM of numbers
grade: 5
focus: Number theory and divisibility
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Apply divisibility rules for 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10 to determine if numbers are divisible without performing division
  - Identify prime numbers and composite numbers by testing divisibility and understanding prime characteristics
  - Find prime factorization of numbers using factor trees and systematic division
  - Determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using prime factorization or listing factors
  - Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using prime factorization or listing multiples
  - Use divisibility and factorization to solve practical problems involving grouping and scheduling
problem_types:
  - Divisibility testing
  - Prime identification
  - Prime factorization
  - Factor trees
  - GCD calculation
  - LCM calculation
  - Common factor problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Divisibility by 2, 5, 10 only; prime numbers under 50
    - Simple factor trees with 2-3 levels
    - GCD and LCM of numbers under 30 with obvious common factors
  medium:
    - Divisibility by 3, 9 in addition to 2, 5, 10; prime numbers under 100
    - Factor trees with 3-4 levels; numbers requiring systematic testing
    - GCD and LCM of numbers under 100 requiring prime factorization
  hard:
    - All divisibility rules combined; identifying larger primes up to 150
    - Complex factorizations; GCD and LCM of numbers up to 200
    - Multi-step problems combining divisibility rules with GCD or LCM
prerequisites:
  - grade4-written-multiplication-division
  - grade3-multiplication-tables
real_world_context:
  - Finding common group sizes for fair division of items among people
  - Scheduling events that repeat at different intervals (bus schedules, rotating shifts)
  - Arranging items in equal rows and columns for displays or seating
  - Determining if quantities can be split evenly without remainders for packaging
  - Finding the smallest shared timing for periodic events (traffic lights, alarms)
  - A florist creating equal bouquets from different flower quantities
  - Organizing sports teams with the same number of players
  - Finding when two planets will align based on their orbit periods
  - A baker dividing dough into equal portions for rolls
  - Scheduling practice sessions that don't conflict for multiple sports
  - Cryptography puzzles using prime numbers as secret keys
  - Tiling patterns that repeat at regular intervals
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid numbers requiring factorization beyond 200
  - Don't test divisibility by 7, 11, or other advanced rules not taught
  - Avoid GCD or LCM with more than 2 numbers
  - Don't mix with fraction operations or decimal notation
  - Avoid abstract contexts without clear real-world grounding
