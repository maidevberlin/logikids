# Written Addition and Subtraction

Generate tasks that guide students through the standard written algorithms for addition and subtraction with multi-digit numbers. Tasks should emphasize the systematic column-by-column approach and the proper handling of regrouping (carrying in addition, borrowing in subtraction).

## Problem Type Variations

Create diverse task structures:

1. **Direct Calculation Tasks**: Present two or three numbers to add or subtract using the standard written method, requiring students to show their work step-by-step
2. **Missing Number Problems**: Give the result and one addend/subtrahend, asking students to find the missing number using the written algorithm
3. **Error Analysis**: Show a partially completed or incorrectly solved problem and ask students to identify and correct mistakes in the regrouping process
4. **Comparison Tasks**: Ask students to calculate two different sums or differences and compare which is larger or find the difference between them
5. **Multi-Step Word Problems**: Present real-world scenarios requiring multiple addition and/or subtraction steps, such as calculating total costs, remaining amounts, or combined quantities
6. **Estimation and Checking**: Ask students to estimate before calculating, then use the written algorithm, and verify their answer matches the estimation range
7. **Inverse Operation Verification**: Calculate a sum/difference and then verify the result by performing the inverse operation
8. **Place Value Focus**: Create problems specifically designed to challenge understanding of regrouping across zeros or multiple consecutive place values
9. **Number Sentence Creation**: Give a word problem scenario and ask students to write the appropriate number sentence before solving using the written algorithm
10. **Pattern Recognition**: Present a series of calculations and ask students to identify patterns in regrouping or predict the next problem's characteristics

## Age-Based Scaffolding

Adapt complexity based on student age:

**For younger students ({{age}} < 9):**
- Focus on two-digit and three-digit numbers only
- Require regrouping in only one or two place values
- Provide visual scaffolding like column headers showing hundreds, tens, ones
- Use concrete contexts with familiar objects and simple scenarios
- Include problems with and without regrouping to build pattern recognition
- Emphasize showing each step of the carrying/borrowing process

**For older students ({{age}} >= 9):**
- Include four-digit numbers and larger
- Create problems requiring regrouping across multiple consecutive place values
- Present problems with multiple zeros requiring repeated borrowing
- Use more abstract contexts and complex multi-step scenarios
- Combine addition and subtraction in single multi-step problems
- Expect students to explain their reasoning and verify results independently

## Difficulty Scaling

Adjust problem complexity based on difficulty level:

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = 'easy'):**
- Two-digit to three-digit numbers
- Regrouping required in only one place value, or no regrouping at all
- Clear column alignment already provided
- Simple one-step word problems with explicit operation cues
- Direct calculation tasks with straightforward numbers

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = 'medium'):**
- Three-digit to four-digit numbers
- Regrouping required across two or more place values
- Some problems include zeros requiring careful borrowing
- Two-step word problems requiring students to identify operations
- Mix of calculation, verification, and error-detection tasks

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = 'hard'):**
- Four-digit numbers and larger
- Multiple consecutive regroupings, including across several zeros
- Three or more step word problems with implicit operation requirements
- Problems combining addition and subtraction in creative ways
- Tasks requiring explanation of the algorithm's logic or justification of steps
- Error analysis requiring deep understanding of place value and regrouping

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Generate diverse number combinations following these principles:

- **Regrouping complexity**: Vary from no regrouping needed, to single-place regrouping, to multiple consecutive regroupings
- **Zero placement**: Include numbers with zeros in different positions (middle, end, multiple zeros) to challenge borrowing understanding
- **Magnitude variation**: Use numbers ranging from two digits up to five or six digits depending on age and difficulty
- **Sum/difference ranges**: Create problems where results span different magnitudes (sometimes larger, sometimes smaller than starting numbers)
- **Realistic contexts**: When using word problems, employ quantities that match real-world scenarios appropriate for the age group
- **Digit variety**: Avoid repetitive digit patterns; use diverse combinations to prevent recognition of specific number facts

## Answer Format and Verification

**For calculation tasks:**
- Require students to show the complete written algorithm with regrouping marks clearly indicated
- Include space for carrying/borrowing notation above or below the problem
- Ask students to write numbers in proper column alignment

**For word problems:**
- Expect a complete number sentence showing the operation
- Require the written calculation with all steps
- Ask for the answer in a complete sentence with appropriate units

**Verification strategies to include:**
- Estimate the answer using rounding before calculating
- Use the inverse operation to check the result (add to check subtraction, subtract to check addition)
- Compare the reasonableness of the answer to the context of the problem

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design some tasks to specifically challenge these typical errors:

- Forgetting to record carried or borrowed values
- Misaligning place values in multi-digit numbers
- Borrowing from zero without continuing to the next place value
- Subtracting the smaller digit from the larger regardless of position
- Failing to adjust the digit after borrowing from it
- Adding regrouped values in the wrong place value column

## Contextual Diversity

Use varied real-world contexts appropriate for third-grade students:

- Shopping and money (calculating total costs, making change)
- Measurement (combining lengths, finding differences in distances)
- Time (calculating durations, finding time differences in minutes)
- Collections and counting (combining sets, finding how many more needed)
- Sports and games (calculating total points, finding score differences)
- Cooking and recipes (combining ingredient amounts, finding remaining quantities)

Ensure contexts are age-appropriate, culturally neutral, and meaningful to students' everyday experiences.

## Visual Representation

**When to use tables or structured layouts:**
- Show the column format for written algorithms with clear place value headers
- Display partially completed calculations for error analysis tasks
- Present multiple related problems in organized rows for comparison tasks

**Avoid:**
- Do not include actual worked examples with specific numbers
- Do not show completed algorithms that could be copied
- Describe the format structure rather than providing copy-able templates

## Key Instructional Emphasis

Tasks should reinforce these fundamental understandings:

- The written algorithm processes one place value at a time, starting from the rightmost column
- Regrouping represents trading between place values (ten ones for one ten, one ten for ten ones)
- The algorithm works the same way regardless of the size of the numbers
- Estimation helps verify that calculated answers are reasonable
- The inverse relationship between addition and subtraction can be used for verification
- Careful column alignment is essential for accurate calculation

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not create tasks that:
- Rely on memorization of specific number facts rather than understanding the algorithm
- Present numbers in horizontal format without guidance on aligning columns
- Use unrealistic contexts or numbers that don't match real-world scenarios
- Focus solely on speed rather than understanding and accuracy
- Neglect the verification and checking steps that build mathematical confidence
- Repeat identical regrouping patterns across multiple problems
