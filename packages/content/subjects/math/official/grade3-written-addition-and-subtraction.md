name: Written Addition and Subtraction
description: Standard written algorithms for addition and subtraction within 1000, including regrouping and result verification
grade: 3
focus: Written calculation procedures
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Perform written addition with numbers up to 1000 using the standard algorithm
  - Perform written subtraction with numbers up to 1000 using the standard algorithm
  - Apply regrouping (carrying) when adding multi-digit numbers
  - Apply regrouping (borrowing) when subtracting multi-digit numbers
  - Verify calculation results using inverse operations
  - Estimate sums and differences to check reasonableness of results
  - Solve multi-step problems involving both addition and subtraction
problem_types:
  - Column addition
  - Column subtraction
  - Addition with regrouping
  - Subtraction with regrouping
  - Result verification
  - Estimation check
  - Multi-step calculation
  - Missing digit
  - Error detection
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Two or three-digit numbers without regrouping required
    - At most one regrouping step in the ones or tens place
    - Direct verification using simple inverse operation
  medium:
    - Three-digit numbers with multiple regrouping steps
    - Problems requiring both carrying and borrowing
    - Estimation before calculating to check reasonableness
  hard:
    - Multiple consecutive regrouping steps across all place values
    - Missing digit problems requiring reverse calculation
    - Error detection in incorrect calculations with explanation needed
prerequisites:
  - grade1-addition-subtraction-to-20
real_world_context:
  - Calculating total costs when shopping with multiple items
  - Determining remaining money after making purchases
  - Computing distances for multi-leg journeys or trips
  - Tracking savings goals by adding deposits and subtracting withdrawals
  - Calculating ingredient quantities when adjusting recipe amounts
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid numbers larger than 1000
  - Don't introduce negative results in subtraction
  - Avoid decimal numbers or fractions
  - Don't mix addition and subtraction in a single column format
  - Avoid scenarios requiring multiplication or division understanding
