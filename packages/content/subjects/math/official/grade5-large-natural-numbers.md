# Large Natural Numbers

Create tasks where {{child_name}} works with numbers up to millions and billions, understanding place value and using powers of ten (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Reading and Writing Large Numbers**: Present numbers in various forms and ask to convert. Give {{6-9}} digit numbers in standard form and ask for word form, or vice versa. Include millions and hundred thousands. Example: "Write 4,567,890 in words" or "Write 'three million, two hundred fifty thousand' in standard form."

2. **Expanded Form with Powers of Ten**: Write numbers like $5,234,600$ as $5 \times 10^6 + 2 \times 10^5 + 3 \times 10^4 + 4 \times 10^3 + 6 \times 10^2$. Vary the number of non-zero digits and position.

3. **Place Value Understanding**: Questions like "In the number {{8,456,321}}, what digit is in the hundred thousands place?" or "What is the value of the {{4}} in {{7,412,839}}?" Use numbers with {{6-9}} digits.

4. **Comparing and Ordering**: Compare {{3-5}} large numbers. "Order from smallest to largest: {{4,567,890}}, {{4,576,809}}, {{4,657,890}}." Vary how similar the numbers are to adjust difficulty.

5. **Rounding Large Numbers**: Round to various place values. "Round {{6,847,293}} to the nearest {{hundred thousand/ten thousand/thousand}}." Include contexts like population or budget figures where rounding makes sense.

6. **Mental Arithmetic with Round Numbers**: Add or subtract multiples of powers of ten. "$4,000,000 + 300,000 = $ ?" or "$7,500,000 - 500,000 = $ ?" Keep calculations manageable for mental math.

7. **Number Patterns with Large Numbers**: Sequences using large numbers. "Continue the pattern: {{100,000}}, {{200,000}}, {{300,000}}, __, __" or "{{5,000,000}}, {{4,500,000}}, {{4,000,000}}, __, __." Vary the increment/decrement.

8. **Real-World Problem Solving**: Context problems with large numbers. "A city has a population of {{2,456,789}}. If {{138,456}} people move to the city, what's the new population?" Round answers appropriately and discuss reasonableness.

Use authentic contexts: world populations, national statistics, space distances (Earth to Moon: ~384,400 km), large stadiums, company revenues. Include both exact calculations and estimation tasks. Emphasize that powers of ten like $10^6$ represents one million ($1,000,000$). Vary whether answers need exact values or rounded approximations.
