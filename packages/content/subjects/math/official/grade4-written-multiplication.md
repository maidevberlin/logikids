# Written Multiplication - Problem Variations

Generate tasks that build proficiency with written multiplication, from single-digit to two-digit multipliers.

## Variation 1: Three-Digit × One-Digit
Calculate using written multiplication:

$${{three_digit}} \times {{one_digit}} = \, ?$$

**Example:** $234 \times 7 = 1638$

**Written method:**
```
    234
  ×   7
  -----
   1638
```
Steps: $7 \times 4 = 28$ (write 8, carry 2), $7 \times 3 = 21 + 2 = 23$ (write 3, carry 2), $7 \times 2 = 14 + 2 = 16$

## Variation 2: Three-Digit × Two-Digit (Standard)
Calculate using written multiplication:

$${{three_digit}} \times {{two_digit}} = \, ?$$

**Example:** $156 \times 23 = 3588$

**Written method:**
```
     156
   ×  23
   -----
     468  (156 × 3)
   3120  (156 × 20)
   -----
   3588
```

## Variation 3: Multiplication with Zeros
Multiply:

$${{number}} \times {{multiplier_with_zero}} = \, ?$$

**Example:** $407 \times 6 = 2442$

**Important:** Pay attention when multiplying with 0 in the middle!
```
    407
  ×   6
  -----
   2442
```

## Variation 4: Word Problem - Cost Calculation
One ticket for the zoo costs €${{price}}$. How much do ${{num_tickets}}$ tickets cost in total?

**Example:** One ticket costs €18, buying 15 tickets → $18 \times 15 = 270$ euros

## Variation 5: Word Problem - Array/Area
A rectangular garden measures ${{length}}$ meters long and ${{width}}$ meters wide. How many square meters is the area of the garden?

**Example:** 24 m long, 18 m wide → $24 \times 18 = 432$ m²

## Variation 6: Estimation Before Calculation
First estimate the result by rounding, then calculate exactly:

$${{a}} \times {{b}} \approx \, ?$$

**Example:** $287 \times 34$
Estimation: $300 \times 30 = 9000$ (rounded)
Exact calculation: $287 \times 34 = 9758$

Compare: Is the exact result close to your estimation?

## Variation 7: Multi-Step Problem with Multiplication
A baker makes ${{loaves_per_day}}$ loaves of bread per day. He works ${{days}}$ days per week. Each loaf requires ${{grams}}$ grams of flour.
a) How many loaves does he make per week?
b) How many grams of flour does he need per week?

**Example:** 45 loaves/day, 6 days/week, 350g flour/loaf
a) $45 \times 6 = 270$ loaves per week
b) $270 \times 350 = 94500$ grams = 94.5 kg flour

## Variation 8: Product of Two Two-Digit Numbers
Calculate:

$${{two_digit_1}} \times {{two_digit_2}} = \, ?$$

**Example:** $47 \times 36 = 1692$

**Written method:**
```
      47
   ×  36
   -----
     282  (47 × 6)
   1410  (47 × 30)
   -----
   1692
```

## Variation 9: Comparison Problem
Calculate both products and compare:

a) ${{a1}} \times {{b1}} = \, ?$
b) ${{a2}} \times {{b2}} = \, ?$

Which product is larger and by how much?

**Example:**
a) $125 \times 8 = 1000$
b) $235 \times 4 = 940$
Answer: Product a) is larger by $1000 - 940 = 60$
