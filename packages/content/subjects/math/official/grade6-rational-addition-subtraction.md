id: grade6-rational-addition-subtraction
name: Adding and Subtracting Rational Numbers
description: Adding and subtracting fractions with same and different denominators, mixed numbers, and decimals using computational strategies and verifying results through estimation
grade: 6
focus: Rational number addition and subtraction
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Justify operation rules for adding and subtracting fractions with examples
  - Add and subtract fractions with same denominators and simplify results
  - Add and subtract fractions with different denominators using common denominators
  - Add and subtract mixed numbers using appropriate strategies
  - Add and subtract decimal numbers with varying place values
  - Apply commutativity and associativity to simplify calculations
  - Verify results through estimation and plausibility checks
problem_types:
  - Same-denominator fraction operations
  - Finding common denominators
  - Unlike-denominator addition
  - Unlike-denominator subtraction
  - Mixed number addition
  - Mixed number subtraction
  - Decimal addition/subtraction
  - Estimation verification
  - Multi-step combinations
  - Missing addend/subtrahend
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Same denominators up to 12, results in proper fractions
    - Common denominators that are simple multiples (e.g., 3 and 6, 4 and 8)
    - Decimals to hundredths place, no regrouping across decimal point
  medium:
    - Different denominators requiring least common multiple up to 30
    - Mixed numbers requiring conversion to improper fractions or regrouping
    - Decimals to thousandths place with regrouping across decimal point
  hard:
    - Complex denominators requiring calculation of least common multiple up to 60
    - Multi-step problems combining fractions and decimals in one expression
    - Problems requiring strategic use of commutativity and associativity
prerequisites:
  - grade6-fractions-basics
  - grade5-decimals
real_world_context:
  - Combining recipe ingredients with different fractional measurements (1/3 cup flour + 1/4 cup sugar)
  - Calculating total distances or durations in sports activities (2.5 km + 1.75 km)
  - Managing budgets with decimal currency amounts (12.45 euros + 8.99 euros)
  - Determining remaining quantities after using portions (3/4 liter - 1/3 liter)
  - Tracking progress toward goals using fractions and percentages
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid denominators larger than 60
  - Don't combine multiplication or division in the same problem
  - Avoid negative numbers (separate concept in Grade 5)
  - Don't use repeating decimals
  - Avoid mixed operations requiring order of operations with parentheses
version: 1.0
