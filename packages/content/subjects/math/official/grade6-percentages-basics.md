name: Introduction to Percentages
description: Understanding percent as per hundred, converting between fractions/decimals/percentages, and basic percentage calculations
grade: 6
ages:
  - 11
  - 12
focus: Numbers and Operations - Percent as a proportion
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Understand percent as "per hundred" and recognize the percent symbol (%)
  - Convert between common fractions (½, ¼, ¾, etc.) and percentages
  - Convert between decimals and percentages
  - Calculate simple percentages of quantities (10%, 25%, 50%)
  - Apply percentages in real-world contexts (discounts, test scores, data representation)
  - Recognize percent as a way to express proportions and compare quantities
problem_types:
  - Visual recognition
  - Fraction conversions
  - Decimal conversions
  - Reverse conversions
  - Simple calculations
  - Shopping discounts
  - Test scores
  - Bar representations
age_guidelines:
  11:
    - Visual 10x10 grids, foundational fractions, simple percentages (10%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 75%)
    - Focus on "per hundred" concept with visual representations in nearly all tasks
    - Whole numbers that divide evenly, concrete contexts (allowance, class votes, game scores)
  12:
    - Complex fractions, less common percentages, reduced visual aids
    - Multi-step scenarios, explain conversion processes, problems with non-whole results
    - Contexts requiring interpretation (weather, news, statistics)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple fraction-to-percentage conversions with visual 10x10 grids
    - Common percentages that divide evenly, single-step problems
    - Calculator and reference charts available, direct questions
  medium:
    - More fractions and percentages requiring calculation, varied results
    - Two-step problems combining concepts, mix of visual and symbolic notation
    - Problems requiring reasoning explanation, comparison tasks
  hard:
    - Less common percentages, reverse problems (finding whole from percentage)
    - Multi-step scenarios with multiple percentages, complex real-world contexts
    - Minimal visual support, calculation and interpretation, data interpretation
prerequisites:
  - grade4-fractions
  - decimal-understanding
real_world_context: Percentages are fundamental to understanding modern life. Students encounter percentages when interpreting test scores (85%), sales and discounts (30% off), weather forecasts (70% chance of rain), nutrition information (daily value percentages), statistics and surveys (52% of people), sports statistics (player shooting percentage), and grade calculations. Percentages provide a standardized way to compare quantities of different sizes, making them essential for financial literacy, data interpretation, and critical thinking.
