name: Introduction to Area
description: >-
  Covering with unit squares; comparing areas; area as measurement
grade: 3
focus: Area measurement and comparison
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Cover shapes completely with unit squares and count them
  - Compare areas of different shapes by counting unit squares
  - Understand that area measures how much space a shape covers
  - Recognize that different shapes can have the same area
  - Estimate and verify the area of irregular shapes using unit squares
  - Identify which shape has a larger or smaller area through comparison
  - Use non-overlapping unit squares to measure area accurately
problem_types:
  - Unit square counting
  - Area comparison
  - Shape covering
  - Same area finding
  - Largest/smallest area
  - Irregular shape area
  - Grid area counting
  - Missing square counting
  - Area estimation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Count unit squares in simple rectangular shapes (up to 20 squares)
    - Compare two shapes with clearly different areas (difference of 5+ squares)
    - Work with fully-covered shapes on visible grids
  medium:
    - Count unit squares in L-shapes or simple irregular shapes (up to 30 squares)
    - Compare shapes with similar areas (difference of 2-4 squares)
    - Find shapes with the same area from a set of options
  hard:
    - Work with complex irregular shapes or partially shown grids (up to 40 squares)
    - Determine missing squares needed to complete a target area
    - Compare multiple shapes and order them by area
prerequisites:
  - grade1-plane-shapes
  - grade2-measurement-skills
real_world_context:
  - Comparing the floor space of different rooms to see which is bigger
  - Figuring out how many square tiles are needed to cover a bathroom floor
  - Comparing the size of different gardens or play areas in a schoolyard
  - Determining which piece of wrapping paper is large enough for a gift
  - Estimating how many carpet squares are needed to cover a classroom reading corner
  - A farmer comparing field sizes to decide what to plant
  - Counting grid squares on a game board to understand play areas
  - An interior designer planning how much wallpaper to order
  - Comparing pizza sizes to see which gives more slices
  - A groundskeeper measuring lawn sections for fertilizer application
  - Calculating fabric needed to make a quilt or blanket
  - Comparing desk surface areas to find the biggest workspace
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using formulas like length × width - focus on counting squares
  - Don't use fractional or partial unit squares at grade 3 level
  - Avoid shapes larger than 40 unit squares - keep counting manageable
  - Don't introduce perimeter in the same problem - keep concepts separate
  - Avoid units like cm² or m² - use "unit squares" or "squares" only
