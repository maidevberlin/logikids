prerequisites:
  - fraction-operations
  - divisibility-prime-numbers
real_world_context: Ratios and proportions permeate everyday life - recipes require scaling ingredients (if 2 cups flour makes 12 cookies, how much flour for 18 cookies?), maps use scale ratios (1 cm represents 10 km), cooking requires understanding ingredient ratios and adjusting portions, shopping involves comparing unit prices and rates, photography and art use aspect ratios and proportional enlargement, sports statistics rely on ratios (points per game, batting averages), medicine uses dose ratios based on weight, construction uses proportional scaling in blueprints, and financial literacy involves rates of return and proportional calculations. Grade 6 students encounter proportional reasoning when resizing images, understanding scale models, calculating travel distances using maps, comparing recipe ingredients, determining fair trades in games or exchanges, and solving problems requiring equivalent reasoning. Mastery of proportions forms the foundation for algebra (linear relationships), geometry (similarity and scale), and practical problem-solving across all domains.

# Task Generation Guidelines for Ratios and Proportions (Grade 6)

Generate tasks that help students develop understanding of ratios as comparisons, recognize and apply proportional relationships, master cross multiplication, and apply proportional reasoning to real-world situations.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse task types that test different aspects of ratio and proportion understanding:

1. **Ratio Expression and Simplification**: Present quantities and ask students to express the ratio in multiple forms (e.g., "the ratio of boys to girls" vs. "the ratio of boys to total students"). Include identifying equivalent ratios and simplifying ratios to lowest terms by finding the GCD of both parts. Include both part-to-part and part-to-whole contexts.

2. **Identifying Proportional Relationships**: Present two or more ratios and ask whether they form a proportion (are they equivalent). Include problems where students determine if ratios are proportional using cross multiplication ($\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ iff $a \times d = b \times c$), scaling, or converting to decimals. Include both proportional and non-proportional pairs to reinforce the distinction.

3. **Solving Proportions Using Cross Multiplication**: Present a proportion with one missing value (e.g., $\frac{3}{4} = \frac{x}{12}$) and ask students to solve using cross multiplication. Vary which quantity is unknown. Include problems producing whole number answers and those requiring simplification or decimal answers.

4. **Unit Rate Problems**: Present quantities and ask students to find the unit rate (e.g., "miles per hour," "cost per item," "pages per minute"). Include problems where finding the unit rate helps answer a follow-up question about a different quantity. Vary the context - speed, price, productivity, consumption rates.

5. **Scaling and Enlargement/Reduction**: Present a quantity and scale factor and ask students to calculate the new quantity. Include problems like "if a recipe serves 4 but you need to serve 10, multiply each ingredient by what factor?" or "if an image is enlarged by a scale factor of 2.5, what is the new size?" Include both integer and decimal scale factors.

6. **Ratio Tables and Patterns**: Present a partially filled ratio table and ask students to complete it, recognizing the constant ratio pattern. Include problems where students identify the relationship, extend the pattern, and use it to solve problems. Include both ascending and descending values.

7. **Proportional Reasoning in Context**: Present real-world scenarios (recipes, maps, scale models, shopping, rates) where proportional reasoning is needed. Ask students to set up and solve proportions, interpret solutions in context, and answer questions requiring proportional thinking.

8. **Comparing Quantities Using Ratios**: Present different ratios or rates and ask students to determine which is "better," "faster," "cheaper," etc. Include problems like "which offer is better: 3 cookies for $2 or 5 cookies for $3?" Require students to justify using ratios or unit rates.

9. **Map Scale and Distance Problems**: Present maps with scales (e.g., "1 inch = 5 miles") and ask students to calculate actual distances or map distances. Include problems requiring measurement and proportional calculation. Connect to real navigation and geography contexts.

10. **Three-Part Ratios**: Present problems involving three quantities in a ratio (e.g., "a mixture has sand, gravel, and cement in the ratio 3:2:1"). Ask students to find quantities when given a total, find the total given one quantity, or determine ratios of parts to whole.

11. **Direct vs. Inverse Proportional Relationships**: Distinguish between direct proportions (when one increases, the other increases proportionally) and inverse proportions (when one increases, the other decreases). Present situations and ask students to identify the relationship type and solve accordingly.

12. **Proportional Reasoning with Percentages**: Connect proportional reasoning to percentage problems - expressing "40% of students" as a ratio (40:100) and solving using proportion method ($\frac{40}{100} = \frac{x}{total}$).

## Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

### Younger Students ({{age}} = 11)
- Focus on simple whole number ratios (2:3, 1:4, 3:5, not more complex like 7:11)
- Use familiar contexts (recipes, sports teams, simple comparisons)
- Emphasize simplification using obvious common factors (2, 3, 5, 10)
- Keep scale factors simple and often integers (2x, 3x, 1.5x)
- Include visual representations (ratio diagrams, double number lines, tape diagrams)
- Provide structured ratio table formats with clear headings
- Ask explicit questions with clear operation selection
- Keep map scales simple (1 inch = 1 mile rather than complex ratios)
- Focus on direct proportional relationships; avoid inverse proportions initially

### Older Students ({{age}} = 12)
- Work with more complex ratios including less obvious common factors
- Include three-part ratios (3:2:1)
- Use scale factors as decimals and fractions (0.5x, 2.5x, ⅔x)
- Reduce scaffolding; expect independent proportion setup
- Include more abstract mathematical contexts
- Work with map scales involving larger numbers and unit conversions
- Include both direct and inverse proportional relationships
- Present problems with less explicit structure, requiring interpretation
- Include comparisons requiring calculation and decision-making

## Difficulty Scaling

- Scale factors that are simple integers (multiply by 2 or 3)
- Familiar contexts with clear operation identification
- Ratio tables with obvious patterns
- Visual support provided for all problems
- Direct proportional relationships only

### Medium

- Proportions with less obvious relationships
- Three-part ratios with at least one calculation step
- Unit rates requiring more calculation (5 items for $12.50)
- Scale factors including simple decimals (1.5x, 2.5x)
- Real-world problems with moderate complexity

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

**Ratio Quantities**: Vary systematically across different ranges. Include small quantities (1:2, 2:3), medium quantities (8:12, 15:20), and larger quantities (25:40, 36:48). Vary the relationship - include some where one part is much larger (1:10, 1:5) and others where parts are more similar (7:8, 5:6).

**Common Factors in Ratios**: Include ratios simplifiable by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and occasionally larger factors. Rotate through different GCDs. Don't repeatedly use ratios with obvious common factors; include 15:25 (GCD=5), 18:24 (GCD=6), 14:35 (GCD=7), 20:30 (GCD=10).

**Proportion Values**: When solving $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{x}$, vary which position is unknown. Include products requiring simplification (e.g., $\frac{3}{5} = \frac{x}{40}$ → cross multiply → 3×40 = 5×x → 120 = 5x → x = 24). Include answers that are whole numbers, simple decimals, and fractions.

**Scale Factors**: Vary between integers (2, 3, 4), simple decimals (1.5, 2.5, 0.5), simple fractions (½, ⅔, 1½), and mixed numbers. Don't overuse factors producing "nice" results; include factors creating "messier" outcomes.

**Real-World Numbers**: Use varied and realistic quantities - small amounts (1 cup flour, 2 tablespoons sugar), medium amounts (3½ cups milk, 2.5 meters), large quantities (500 miles, 50 students). Avoid always using convenient round numbers; include values requiring calculation.

**Rates and Prices**: Vary unit prices from very cheap ($.25) to moderate ($3.50) to expensive ($25). Vary quantities from single items to bulk purchases. Include prices that don't result in convenient unit prices (e.g., 7 items for $2.45).

## Format and Presentation Guidance

### When to Use Visual Elements

**For {{age}} = 11 or {{difficulty}} = easy:**
- Include ratio diagrams or tape diagrams for nearly all tasks
- Show double number lines for proportion solving
- Use area models or rectangular arrays for understanding ratios visually
- Provide ratio tables with clear structure
- Visual comparison of quantities

**For {{age}} = 12 and {{difficulty}} = medium:**
- Include visual representations for about half of tasks, especially for less familiar problem types
- Use double number lines for some proportion problems
- Provide diagrams for complex real-world problems
- Allow symbolic work for straightforward calculations
- Tables for organizing proportion data

**For {{difficulty}} = hard:**
- Use visuals selectively - primarily for verification or complex multi-step problems
- Emphasize symbolic notation and abstract relationships
- Include diagrams mainly for real-world problems with complex setup
- Most problems use purely symbolic representation

### When to Use Tables

- Organizing ratio data (showing the constant ratio pattern across multiple values)
- Solving proportions by listing equivalent ratios
- Comparing different unit rates side-by-side
- Scale drawings or map problems (organized measurements)
- Recording steps in multi-step proportion problems
- Showing the relationship between quantities in three-part ratios

### When to Use Double Number Lines

- Visualizing proportional scaling (one quantity on top, related quantity on bottom)
- Finding missing values in proportions
- Comparing ratios visually
- Understanding how quantities scale together
- Solving unit rate problems

### When to Use Ratio Diagrams/Tape Diagrams

- Representing part-to-part and part-to-whole relationships
- Showing the comparison between quantities
- Scaling problems (showing original and scaled amounts)
- Three-part ratios (divided sections for each part)
- Recipe or mixture problems

## Language Considerations

Use precise mathematical vocabulary consistently:

- **Ratio** (Verhältnis) - a comparison of two or more quantities using division
- **Part-to-part ratio** (Verhältnis Teil zu Teil) - comparing one part to another part
- **Part-to-whole ratio** (Verhältnis Teil zum Ganzen) - comparing one part to the total
- **Equivalent ratios** (Gleichwertige Verhältnisse) - ratios that represent the same relationship
- **Simplify a ratio** (Verhältnis vereinfachen/kürzen) - reduce to lowest terms
- **Proportion** (Proportion/Verhältnisgleichung) - statement that two ratios are equal
- **Cross multiplication** (Kreuzweise Multiplikation) - method for solving proportions
- **Scale factor** (Skalierungsfaktor) - the number by which to multiply quantities when scaling
- **Unit rate** (Einheitsrate) - the quantity per 1 unit of another quantity
- **Proportional relationship** (Proportionale Beziehung) - relationship where ratios remain constant
- **Direct proportion** (Direktes Verhältnis/Direkte Proportionalität) - as one quantity increases, the other increases proportionally
- **Inverse proportion** (Umgekehrtes Verhältnis/Umgekehrte Proportionalität) - as one quantity increases, the other decreases proportionally

Define these terms explicitly when introducing new vocabulary and use them consistently throughout all tasks.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**DO NOT:**
- Assume students can automatically simplify ratios; explicitly teach GCD application
- Present proportions without explaining the cross multiplication conceptual basis
- Use only simple unit rates; include rates that don't produce whole number unit rates
- Present ratios without distinguishing between part-to-part and part-to-whole contexts
- Focus exclusively on algebra-style proportion solving without real-world application
- Use only contexts where quantities increase; include scaling down and reductions
- Mix ratios and fractions indiscriminately without clarification
- Create problems where multiple different answers could be correct due to ambiguous wording
- Ignore inverse proportional relationships; include both types
- Present map or scale drawing problems without clear scale labeling
- Assume students can visualize three-part ratios; provide clear diagrams

**Ensure Variety By:**
- Rotating through all problem structure types listed above
- Alternating between ratio application, proportion solving, and real-world contexts
- Varying ratio sizes and required simplification systematically
- Using diverse real-world contexts (cooking, maps, shopping, rates, comparisons, scale models, sports)
- Balancing part-to-part and part-to-whole ratio problems
- Including both direct and inverse proportional relationships
- Mixing simple whole number ratios with more complex ones requiring factor calculation
- Combining visual representations with purely symbolic work
- Including both "find the missing value" and "determine if proportional" types of problems
- Varying between problems requiring exact answers and those requiring estimation or comparison

## Connection to Curriculum Standards

This concept aligns with the KMK Bildungsstandards für Mathematik, Sekundarstufe I (Secondary Level I), within the content area "Zahlbereiche und deren Eigenschaften" (Number systems and their properties), "Rechenoperationen und ihre Eigenschaften" (Arithmetic operations and their properties), and particularly "Größen und Messen" (Quantities and measurement).

Specifically, students develop:
- Competency in representing and understanding ratios in multiple forms
- Procedural fluency in setting up and solving proportions
- Strategic competency in choosing appropriate methods (cross multiplication, scaling, unit rate) for different proportion problems
- Reasoning competency in recognizing proportional relationships and applying proportional thinking to varied contexts
- Understanding of how proportions connect to fractions, percentages, and real-world measurement

Grade 6 proportional reasoning forms the bridge between arithmetic understanding of fractions and the algebraic thinking required for linear relationships, equations, and functions in later grades. Mastery of proportions is essential for geometry (similarity, scale drawings), statistics (ratios and rates), and practical problem-solving.
