id: grade7-statistical-measures
name: Statistical Measures
description: Calculate and interpret mean, median, mode, range, quartiles, and boxplots for statistical data analysis and comparison
grade: 7
focus: Statistical measures and data analysis
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Calculate arithmetic mean from data sets and understand its properties
  - Determine median and explain when it is more appropriate than mean
  - Identify mode and interpret its significance in data distributions
  - Calculate range as a measure of spread and variability
  - Determine quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) and understand their meaning
  - Create boxplots from five-number summaries
  - Compare multiple data sets using statistical measures
problem_types:
  - Mean calculation
  - Median determination
  - Mode identification
  - Range calculation
  - Quartile finding
  - Boxplot construction
  - Boxplot interpretation
  - Measure comparison
  - Five-number summary
  - Data set analysis
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Calculate mean, median, mode, range for small ordered data sets (5-8 values)
    - Read values directly from given boxplots
    - Identify which measure of central tendency is largest or smallest
  medium:
    - Determine quartiles from unordered data sets (8-12 values)
    - Compare mean and median to interpret data skewness
    - Create boxplots from calculated five-number summaries
  hard:
    - Analyze and compare multiple data sets using all statistical measures
    - Interpret spread and outliers from boxplots
    - Make comparative statements about distributions based on statistical measures
prerequisites:
  - grade6-data-diagrams
real_world_context:
  - Analyzing test scores in a class to understand performance distribution and identify outliers
  - Comparing weather data across different cities using boxplots to see temperature ranges
  - Evaluating sports statistics like player scores to determine consistent vs. variable performance
  - Understanding salary distributions in job advertisements using median instead of mean
  - Analyzing survey results with quartiles to identify how most people responded
  - Video game leaderboards showing player ranking distributions and percentiles
  - Music streaming services analyzing listening patterns across different genres
  - Restaurant reviewers comparing rating distributions between establishments
  - Fitness apps summarizing weekly workout statistics with averages and ranges
  - Online shoppers comparing product ratings using mean vs. mode of reviews
  - Teachers analyzing homework completion rates across different class periods
  - Environmental scientists comparing pollution levels across monitoring stations
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid data sets with more than 15 values without technology support
  - Don't introduce interquartile range (IQR) or outlier calculation formulas
  - Avoid interpolation for median or quartiles with even-numbered data sets
  - Don't mix continuous and discrete data types in the same problem
  - Avoid contexts requiring interpretation of standard deviation or variance
