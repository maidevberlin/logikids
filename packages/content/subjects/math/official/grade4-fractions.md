id: grade4-fractions
name: Introduction to Fractions
description: Understanding fractions as parts of a whole, fraction notation, visual representation, comparing and ordering fractions with same denominators, recognizing equivalent fractions, and applying fractions in everyday contexts
grade: 4
focus: Fraction concept and basic relationships
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand fractions as equal parts of a whole and identify numerator, denominator, and fraction bar
  - Represent fractions visually using area models (circles, rectangles) and number lines
  - Compare and order fractions with the same denominators using visual and numerical reasoning
  - Recognize and identify equivalent fractions (halves, quarters, thirds, sixths)
  - Apply fraction concepts to solve simple real-world problems involving parts of quantities
problem_types:
  - Fraction identification
  - Visual representation
  - Part-whole relationships
  - Fraction comparison
  - Equivalent fractions
  - Number line placement
  - Real-world application
  - Fraction ordering
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Unit fractions and simple fractions (halves, quarters, thirds) with denominators up to 6
    - Visual models clearly divided into equal parts
    - Comparing fractions with same denominators only (e.g., 2/5 vs 4/5)
  medium:
    - Fractions with denominators up to 10, including mixed numerators
    - Comparing and ordering 3-4 fractions with same denominators
    - Simple equivalent fractions (1/2=2/4, 1/3=2/6)
  hard:
    - Denominators up to 12, comparing fractions across different denominators when equivalent
    - Multiple representations of the same fraction (visual, symbolic, word form)
    - Complex part-whole scenarios requiring fraction identification and comparison
prerequisites:
  - grade3-multiplication-division-strategies
real_world_context:
  - Sharing food equally among friends (pizza slices, chocolate bars, apples)
  - Measuring ingredients in cooking and baking recipes
  - Telling time with analog clocks (quarter past, half past)
  - Dividing toys, stickers, or craft materials among classmates
  - Understanding portions in sports (quarter of a game, half-time)
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid fractions with denominators larger than 12
  - Don't introduce multiplication or division of fractions
  - Avoid comparing fractions with different denominators (except equivalents)
  - Don't use improper fractions or mixed numbers
  - Avoid abstract contexts unfamiliar to 9-10 year olds
