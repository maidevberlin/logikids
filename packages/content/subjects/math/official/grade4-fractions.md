description: Understanding fractions as parts of a whole, fraction notation, and comparing simple fractions
grade: 4
ages:
  - 9
  - 10
focus: Numbers and Operations
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Understand fractions as parts of a whole or a quantity
  - Recognize and use fraction notation (numerator, denominator, fraction bar)
  - Represent fractions pictorially and symbolically
  - Compare and order simple fractions with same denominators
  - Identify and use common fractions (½, ¼, ⅓, ⅕, ⅛, etc.)
  - Find equivalent fractions through visual representation
  - Apply fractions in everyday contexts (time, measurement, sharing)
real_world_context: Fractions appear in everyday life when dividing objects, measuring ingredients in recipes, telling time (quarter hour, half hour), describing distances, and sharing items fairly. Students encounter fractions when working with money (half a euro), lengths (quarter meter), and quantities (one-third of a group). Understanding fractions builds foundation for later work with decimals, percentages, and ratio concepts.
version: 1
version_notes: Migrated to frontmatter-only format with problem_types, age_guidelines, and difficulty_guidelines
problem_types:
  - Part-whole identification
  - Fraction notation
  - Fraction comparison
  - Equivalent fractions
  - Real-world application
  - Fraction ordering
  - Missing parts
  - Fraction creation
  - Word problems
  - Unit fractions
age_guidelines:
  9:
    - Focus heavily on visual representations (circles, rectangles, bars)
    - Use common, familiar fractions (½, ¼, ⅓)
    - Keep denominators small (up to 8)
    - Use concrete, everyday contexts (pizza, chocolate, apples)
    - Primarily comparison of fractions with same denominators
    - Questions should be more qualitative ("Which is bigger?")
    - Provide visual aids in task presentation
  10:
    - Increase use of symbolic notation alongside visuals
    - Introduce less common fractions (⅕, ⅙, ⅛, 1/10)
    - Allow for larger denominators (up to 12)
    - Use more varied contexts (measurement units, distances, groups of objects)
    - Include comparison of fractions with different denominators (using visual support)
    - Mix qualitative and quantitative questions
    - Reduce reliance on visual aids, emphasize symbolic understanding
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-step fraction identification or comparison
    - Common fractions only (½, ¼, ⅓)
    - Visual representations always provided
    - Same denominators for all comparison tasks
    - Clear, unambiguous everyday contexts
    - Direct questions with obvious answers
  medium:
    - Two-step problems requiring reasoning
    - Include fifths, sixths, eighths
    - Mix of visual and symbolic representations
    - Some comparison with different denominators (e.g., ½ vs. ⅓)
    - More complex real-world scenarios requiring interpretation
    - May require finding equivalent fractions using visuals
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining concepts
    - All common fractions including tenths and twelfths
    - Primarily symbolic notation with minimal visual support
    - Comparison requiring understanding of relative sizes
    - Complex word problems with multiple fractions
    - Problems requiring both equivalent fractions and ordering
