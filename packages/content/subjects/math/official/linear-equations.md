# Linear Equations Tasks

Create mathematics problems that explore solving linear equations with one variable using equivalent transformations. Problems should help students understand the balance principle, apply systematic solution strategies, and connect abstract equations to real-world contexts.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Simple two-step equations** like $2x + 5 = 13$ or $3x - 7 = 8$: Solve using addition/subtraction then multiplication/division
- **Equations with variables on both sides** like $5x + 3 = 2x + 15$: Collect variable terms on one side and constants on the other
- **Equations with brackets** like $3(x + 4) = 21$ or $2(x - 3) = x + 5$: Multiply out brackets first, then solve
- **Equations with fractions** like $\frac{x}{3} + 2 = 5$ or $\frac{2x-1}{4} = 3$: Clear fractions by multiplying both sides
- **Word problems requiring equation setup**: Translate verbal descriptions into equations, then solve (age problems, number puzzles, pricing)
- **Solution checking**: Provide an equation and a proposed solution, ask students to verify by substitution
- **Special cases**: Present equations with no solution (e.g., $2x + 3 = 2x + 5$) or infinitely many solutions (e.g., $3x + 6 = 3(x + 2)$)
- **Creating equations from contexts**: Give a situation and ask students to write the corresponding equation

**Vary the content/context:**
- **Number puzzles**: "A number increased by 8 equals 23", "Three times a number minus 5 equals 16"
- **Age problems**: "Maria is 3 years older than Tom. The sum of their ages is 27. How old is Tom?"
- **Distance and travel**: "A car travels at 60 km/h. How long to cover 180 km?"
- **Money and pricing**: "A shirt costs €x. After a €5 discount, it costs €28. Find the original price"
- **Geometry**: "The perimeter of a rectangle with length 2x and width x is 36 cm. Find x"
- **Temperature conversion**: Using formulas like $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$
- **Mixture problems**: "Mixing solutions with different concentrations"
- **Abstract equations**: Pure algebraic equations without context to develop symbolic reasoning

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 13): Simple two-step equations with positive integers, clear contexts, small numbers, whole number solutions only
- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 13-14): Variables on both sides, simple brackets, basic fractions, negative numbers, word problems with straightforward translation
- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 15): Complex brackets, multiple fractions, multi-step word problems, special cases, decimal coefficients, abstract reasoning

**Use appropriate formats:**

**LaTeX for equations:**
- Inline for simple equations: Solve $2x + 7 = 15$
- Block for complex equations:

$$3(2x - 5) + 4 = 2(x + 3) - 1$$

$$\frac{2x + 3}{4} - \frac{x - 1}{2} = 5$$

**Step-by-step solution format:**
Show systematic solution process:

$$2x + 5 = 13$$
$$2x = 8$$
$$x = 4$$

**Tables for context problems:**

| Item     | Quantity | Price   | Total    |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| Apples   | x        | €2      | 2x       |
| Oranges  | 5        | €3      | 15       |

Total cost: €25. Find x.

**Adjust difficulty with {{difficulty}}:**
- **Easy**: One or two-step equations, positive whole numbers, variable on one side only, direct contexts (e.g., "x + 5 = 12"), whole number solutions
- **Medium**: Variables on both sides, simple brackets or simple fractions, negative numbers, two-step word problems, may require one unit conversion
- **Hard**: Complex brackets, multiple fractions, equations requiring multiple transformation steps, abstract contexts, special cases (no solution or infinite solutions), decimal or fractional solutions

**Include variety in numerical values:**
- Different coefficients: 2, 3, 5, 7, -2, -4, 0.5
- Various constants: 8, 15, 24, -6, 100, 0
- Different solutions: x = 2, x = 5, x = -3, x = 0, x = 10, x = 1.5
- Age values: 8, 12, 15, 25, 40 years
- Prices: €5, €12, €25, €50, €100
- Distances: 50 km, 120 km, 300 km
- Ensure different numerical answers to prevent memorization and promote understanding of the process
