name: Numbers and Operations to 100
description: Understanding place value, addition, subtraction, comparing, ordering, and rounding numbers within the range 0-100
grade: 2
ages:
  - 7
  - 8
focus: Number sense and arithmetic foundations
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Understand the decimal place value system to 100 (ones and tens)
  - Add and subtract two-digit numbers using various mental and semi-written strategies
  - Compare and order numbers to 100 using symbols and number lines
  - Round numbers to the nearest ten
  - Check calculations using inverse operations
  - Recognize and apply patterns in the base-ten system
prerequisites:
  - grade1-addition-up-to-10
  - grade1-subtraction-up-to-10
  - grade1-number-concept-development
real_world_context: Counting money, measuring lengths, understanding house and page numbers, shopping problems, calendar dates
problem_types:
  - Place value decomposition
  - Number comparison
  - Rounding to tens
  - Addition within 100
  - Subtraction within 100
  - Mixed operations
  - Inverse operations
  - Number patterns
  - Estimation tasks
  - Real-world applications
age_guidelines:
  7:
    - Use concrete contexts and visual representations
    - Focus on numbers up to 50-60
    - Emphasize operations without regrouping first
    - Provide scaffolding with intermediate steps
    - Use familiar everyday contexts (toys, sweets, simple shopping)
  8:
    - Include more abstract numerical problems
    - Use the full number range to 100
    - Expect fluency with regrouping in both operations
    - Require multi-step reasoning and strategy selection
    - Include more complex real-world contexts (saving money over time, measurement conversions)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct calculation with numbers mostly below 50
    - Clear indication which operation to use
    - Addition and subtraction without regrouping preferred
    - Single-step problems
    - Straightforward comparison and ordering tasks
    - Round numbers ending in 1-4 or 6-9 (unambiguous rounding)
  medium:
    - Full number range to 100
    - Some problems requiring regrouping
    - Two-step problems or those requiring strategy choice
    - Missing number problems (find the unknown addend, subtrahend, or minuend)
    - Rounding numbers ending in 5 (discuss conventions)
    - Simple estimation and reasonableness checking
  hard:
    - Complex multi-step problems
    - Multiple valid solution strategies (require explanation of chosen method)
    - Problems combining place value understanding with calculation
    - Inverse operation reasoning and verification
    - Pattern recognition and rule articulation
    - Problems requiring estimation first, then verification
    - Numbers near boundaries (e.g., 99 + something, subtracting across 10 or 50)
