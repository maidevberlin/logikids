# Numbers and Operations to 100

Generate tasks that help students develop number sense and computational fluency within the number range 0-100, emphasizing place value understanding, flexible calculation strategies, and number relationships.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse problem types testing different aspects of number understanding and operations:

1. **Place Value Decomposition**: Break numbers into tens and ones, represent numbers using different models (base-ten blocks description, place value charts, expanded form), identify the value of specific digits

2. **Number Comparison and Ordering**: Compare two or more numbers using greater than/less than relationships, arrange numbers in ascending or descending order, identify numbers between given values, place numbers on number lines

3. **Rounding to Tens**: Round given numbers to the nearest ten, explain which ten a number is closer to, identify all numbers that round to a specific ten

4. **Addition Within 100**: Add two-digit numbers with and without regrouping, use different strategies (counting on, making tens, breaking apart by place value, near doubles), solve missing addend problems

5. **Subtraction Within 100**: Subtract two-digit numbers with and without regrouping, use different strategies (counting back, counting up, using related addition facts, breaking apart by place value), solve missing subtrahend or minuend problems

6. **Mixed Operations**: Solve problems requiring both addition and subtraction, determine which operation to use in word problems, find unknown values in number sentences

7. **Inverse Operations**: Check addition by subtraction and vice versa, find missing numbers using inverse thinking, explain why inverse operations work

8. **Number Patterns**: Identify and continue patterns involving addition or subtraction (counting by fives, tens, or other increments), describe pattern rules, find missing elements in sequences

9. **Estimation**: Estimate sums and differences before calculating, determine if answers are reasonable, decide when exact answers versus estimates are needed

10. **Real-World Applications**: Solve problems involving money, measurement, time, or everyday quantities using addition and subtraction within 100

## Age-Based Complexity

Adjust cognitive demand and abstraction level based on student age:

### Younger Students (age < 8)
- Use concrete contexts and visual representations (describe pictures, objects, or manipulatives rather than abstract numbers)
- Focus on numbers primarily in the lower half of the range (up to 50-60)
- Emphasize addition and subtraction without regrouping first
- Provide more scaffolding with intermediate steps shown
- Use familiar everyday contexts (toys, sweets, simple shopping)

### Older Students (age >= 8)
- Include more abstract numerical problems without pictorial support
- Use the full number range to 100 confidently
- Expect fluency with regrouping in both addition and subtraction
- Require multi-step reasoning and strategy selection
- Include more complex real-world contexts (saving money over time, measurement conversions within metric system)

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy
- Direct calculation with numbers mostly below 50
- Clear indication which operation to use
- Addition and subtraction without regrouping preferred
- Single-step problems
- Straightforward comparison and ordering tasks
- Round numbers ending in 1-4 or 6-9 (unambiguous rounding)

### Medium
- Full number range to 100
- Some problems requiring regrouping
- Two-step problems or those requiring strategy choice
- Missing number problems (find the unknown addend, subtrahend, or minuend)
- Rounding numbers ending in 5 (discuss conventions)
- Simple estimation and reasonableness checking

### Hard
- Complex multi-step problems
- Multiple valid solution strategies (require explanation of chosen method)
- Problems combining place value understanding with calculation
- Inverse operation reasoning and verification
- Pattern recognition and rule articulation
- Problems requiring estimation first, then verification
- Numbers near boundaries (e.g., 99 + something, subtracting across 10 or 50)

## Numerical Variation Principles

Vary numbers systematically to prevent repetition:

- **Digit Distribution**: Use combinations where digits differ by varying amounts (consecutive, far apart, same digit repeated, zero in ones or tens place)
- **Regrouping Requirements**: Mix problems that do and don't require regrouping in different positions
- **Magnitude Spread**: Include numbers from all parts of the range (teens, twenties through fifties, sixties through nineties)
- **Special Numbers**: Incorporate decade numbers (multiples of ten), near-decade numbers (one more or less than multiples of ten), doubles, near-doubles
- **Randomization**: Ensure no predictable patterns in which numbers appear together

## Format and Representation Guidance

### When to Use Different Formats

- **Number Lines**: For ordering, comparing, rounding, and visualizing number relationships; describe positions and intervals rather than drawing
- **Place Value Charts**: When emphasizing tens and ones decomposition; describe table structure
- **Word Problems**: For real-world applications and operation selection; vary contexts broadly
- **Number Sentences**: For practicing pure calculation and finding unknowns; use boxes or symbols for missing values
- **Visual Models**: Describe base-ten representations (bundles of ten and individual units) without providing actual diagrams

### Calculation Presentation

Present calculations in multiple formats to build flexibility:
- Horizontal number sentences (e.g., describing an equation in words)
- Vertical format descriptions for traditional algorithms
- Part-part-whole relationship descriptions
- Comparison statements with symbols described

## Strategy Emphasis

Encourage multiple valid approaches rather than prescribing single methods:

- **Making Tens**: Decompose numbers to create friendly decade numbers
- **Counting On/Back**: Efficient for small differences
- **Breaking Apart by Place Value**: Add/subtract tens and ones separately
- **Using Known Facts**: Build on memorized combinations and doubles
- **Compensation**: Adjust one number to make calculation easier, then compensate
- **Number Line Jumps**: Visualize jumps forward or backward

Explicitly ask students to explain or choose strategies to build metacognition about calculation methods.

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design tasks that help students confront and overcome typical errors:

- Misunderstanding place value (treating two-digit number as two separate digits)
- Incorrect regrouping (subtracting smaller from larger regardless of position)
- Reversing comparison symbols
- Rounding confusion (always rounding up or down, not to nearest)
- Forgetting to check work using inverse operations

## Context Variety

While the backend variation system handles context diversity, align problems with developmentally appropriate scenarios:

- Personal contexts (age, height in cm, number of items owned)
- School contexts (students in class, books read, crayons, stickers)
- Home and family (household items, siblings, days until events)
- Shopping and money (prices in whole euros or multiples of ten cents, change calculations)
- Measurement (lengths in centimeters, weights in grams for light objects)
- Time (days, weeks, simple calendar arithmetic)

## Task Quality Guidelines

Every generated task should:

- Have exactly one correct answer (or clearly defined set of valid answers for open questions)
- Use numbers that produce results within the 0-100 range (avoid negative results or sums over 100)
- Match the specified difficulty level consistently
- Include necessary context without excess information
- Use clear, grade-appropriate language
- For multiple-choice, provide plausible distractors based on common errors (miscounting, misapplying regrouping, place value errors)

## Language Considerations

The task generator will translate all tasks, but ensure the mathematical structure is language-neutral:

- Use internationally understood number representations
- Avoid idioms or culture-specific references that don't translate
- Keep sentence structures simple for easier translation
- Focus on mathematical vocabulary that has clear equivalents across languages
