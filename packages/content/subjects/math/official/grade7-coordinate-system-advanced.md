learning_objectives:
  - Plot points accurately in all four quadrants of the coordinate system using ordered pairs (x, y)
  - Understand and identify the quadrants (I, II, III, IV) and use proper notation for coordinates
  - Graph linear relationships from equations, tables, and real-world descriptions
  - Interpret and calculate slope as the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change (rise over run)
  - Identify and interpret the y-intercept (where a line crosses the y-axis) in equations and graphs
  - Distinguish between positive slope (increasing), negative slope (decreasing), zero slope (horizontal), and undefined slope (vertical)
  - Convert between different forms of linear equations (slope-intercept form, point-slope form, standard form)
  - Create and graph equations of lines representing real-world situations (distance over time, temperature changes, cost functions)

real_world_context: The coordinate system and linear functions are fundamental tools for understanding relationships between quantities in the real world. Students encounter these concepts when analyzing motion (speed as slope of a distance-time graph), economics (cost functions, profit margins), weather (temperature trends, seasonal changes), engineering (designing ramps, bridges, structural angles), science (velocity, acceleration, proportional relationships), navigation (maps, GPS coordinates), and business (growth rates, revenue models). Grade 7 students develop the ability to represent abstract mathematical relationships visually and to extract meaningful information from graphs and equations. Mastery of coordinate graphing and linear functions provides essential skills for higher mathematics (quadratic functions, systems of equations, calculus), STEM fields, data analysis, and everyday problem-solving. Understanding how to interpret slope in context—whether it represents speed, cost per unit, or rate of change—enables students to make predictions and informed decisions based on data.

age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Use smaller coordinate grids with grid lines and labeled axes
    - Limit slopes to simple values initially (m = 1, 2, -1, -2, 1/2, -1/2)
    - Provide gridded backgrounds for all graphing tasks
    - Focus on slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) initially, introduce other forms later
    - Use whole number coordinates more frequently than fractions
    - Provide step-by-step structure for finding equations from points
    - Use concrete, familiar real-world contexts (video game characters moving, simple costs)
    - Emphasize visual verification (counting rise and run on grids) before symbolic calculation
    - Include units and scales clearly in all graphs
    - Use smaller coordinate values (usually -10 to 10 range)
  13:
    - Work with larger coordinate ranges and variable grid intervals
    - Calculate slope from any two points without grid support
    - Work fluently with fractional and negative slopes
    - Convert between different equation forms (slope-intercept, standard, point-slope)
    - Work with applications involving larger numbers and real-world context
    - Analyze systems of equations and intersection points algebraically
    - Work with less familiar or more complex scenarios
    - Understand slope in abstract contexts beyond physical movement
    - Use standard form and point-slope form with confidence
    - Apply distance formula to non-axis-aligned segments

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Plotting and identifying points with positive integer coordinates only or on grids with clear marking
    - Points primarily in Quadrant I initially, then introducing other quadrants one at a time
    - Simple equations with slope m = 1, 2, or 1/2 and integer y-intercepts
    - Graphs with clear grid lines and reasonable scale
    - Slope calculated from obvious rise and run (e.g., up 2, right 1)
    - Y-intercept directly visible on graphs
    - Real-world contexts with straightforward relationships (constant speed, consistent hourly wage)
    - Distance calculations between axis-aligned points or simple diagonal segments
    - Equations in slope-intercept form primarily
    - Small coordinate values (-10 to 10)
  medium:
    - Plotting points with negative coordinates and fractional coordinates
    - Points distributed across all four quadrants
    - Equations with various slopes including negative slopes and non-unit fractions (m = 3/2, -2/3, -5/4)
    - Lines that don't pass through obvious grid points
    - Slope calculation from two arbitrary points
    - Y-intercept that may be a fraction or negative
    - Real-world contexts requiring setup of equations (distance-time problems, cost functions with fixed costs)
    - Distance calculations using the distance formula or Pythagorean theorem
    - Converting between slope-intercept and standard forms
    - Coordinate ranges from -20 to 20
    - Graphs without grid lines requiring axis labeling and scaling
    - Interpreting slope and intercept in realistic contexts
  hard:
    - Points with fractional and irrational coordinates
    - Steeper slopes and negative slopes requiring careful scaling
    - Multiple representations of the same line (different equation forms)
    - Systems of two linear equations requiring intersection analysis
    - Slope calculated from abstract contexts or tables without visual support
    - Real-world scenarios with multiple constraints or unusual relationships
    - Complex applications requiring model creation from descriptions
    - Distance calculations with irrational distances (e.g., √13)
    - Analysis of parallel lines (same slope) and perpendicular lines (negative reciprocal slopes)
    - Larger coordinate ranges and variable scales
    - Creating and interpreting equations from data tables with noise or gaps
    - Using linear functions to make predictions and analyze the validity of models
