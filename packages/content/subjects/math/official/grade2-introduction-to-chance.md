name: Introduction to Chance
description: Understanding certain, possible, and impossible events through simple experiments
grade: 2
focus: Basic probability and chance
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Identify events as certain, possible, or impossible in everyday situations
  - Describe likelihood of simple events using probability vocabulary
  - Conduct simple experiments to observe outcomes and frequency
  - Compare the likelihood of different events occurring
  - Make predictions about which outcomes are more or less likely
problem_types:
  - Event classification
  - Likelihood comparison
  - Outcome prediction
  - Experiment interpretation
  - Real-world scenarios
  - Possible vs impossible
  - Certainty identification
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Clear certain or impossible events (e.g., sun rising, flying without wings)
    - Binary choices (will happen / won't happen)
    - Familiar everyday situations only
  medium:
    - Distinguishing between possible and certain
    - Simple comparisons (more likely / less likely)
    - Basic experiment outcomes with 2-3 possibilities
  hard:
    - Multiple event comparison (which is most/least likely)
    - Experiments with 4-5 different outcomes
    - Context requiring reasoning about probability
prerequisites:
  - grade1-patterns-and-data
real_world_context:
  - Predicting whether it will rain, snow, or be sunny based on simple observations
  - Understanding that picking a red marble from a jar of only blue marbles is impossible
  - Knowing that drawing a name from a hat could be any student in the class
  - Recognizing that rolling a standard die will give a number between 1 and 6
  - Comparing likelihood of events like finding a shell at the beach versus in the forest
  - A fortune teller at a fair predicting possible outcomes from a crystal ball
  - Guessing which flavor gumball will come out of a machine
  - Predicting whether a soccer team will win, lose, or draw
  - Wondering if a knocked-over tower of blocks will fall left or right
  - Deciding which card might be drawn next in a memory game
  - Predicting if the school bus will arrive early, on time, or late
  - Guessing which balloon will pop first at a party game
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid numerical probabilities or fractions (e.g., 1/2, 50%)
  - Don't use terms beyond certain/possible/impossible/likely/unlikely
  - Avoid complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
  - Don't introduce formal experiments with data recording or tallying
  - Avoid events that require specialized knowledge to judge likelihood
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
