id: grade9-compound-probability
name: Compound Probability
description: Understanding compound events through set notation, Venn diagrams, contingency tables, and calculating probabilities of unions and intersections using the addition rule.
grade: 9
focus: Probability theory and set operations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Represent compound events using set notation and identify unions and intersections
  - Use Venn diagrams to visualize relationships between overlapping events
  - Create and interpret contingency tables to organize compound event data
  - Derive and apply the addition rule P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
  - Calculate probabilities of unions and intersections from given information
  - Distinguish between mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive events
  - Solve real-world problems involving compound probability
problem_types:
  - Venn diagram analysis
  - Contingency table completion
  - Union probability
  - Intersection probability
  - Mutually exclusive events
  - Set notation translation
  - Addition rule application
  - Three-set problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple two-event scenarios with clear overlap
    - Direct probability calculations from completed Venn diagrams or tables
    - Mutually exclusive events where P(A∩B) = 0
  medium:
    - Two or three events requiring addition rule application
    - Incomplete contingency tables requiring deduction
    - Problems requiring conversion between visual and numerical representations
  hard:
    - Three-event compound probabilities with multiple overlaps
    - Problems requiring multiple steps to find P(A∩B) before using addition rule
    - Real-world scenarios requiring careful event definition and modeling
prerequisites:
  - grade8-laplace-probability
real_world_context:
  - Medical testing uses contingency tables to show relationships between test results and actual conditions, calculating probabilities of false positives and true positives
  - Quality control in manufacturing tracks defects by type using Venn diagrams to identify products with multiple issues versus single issues
  - Survey analysis uses contingency tables to examine relationships between demographics and preferences, such as age groups and product choices
  - Insurance companies calculate compound probabilities when assessing multiple risk factors, such as the probability of accidents given weather conditions and driver experience
  - Social media analytics use set operations to analyze user overlap between different platforms or interest groups
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) without checking for overlap
  - Don't create Venn diagrams where regions don't sum to 1 or total sample size
  - Avoid contingency tables with inconsistent row or column totals
  - Don't use abstract symbols without defining what events A and B represent
  - Avoid three-set problems without visual support for Grade 9
