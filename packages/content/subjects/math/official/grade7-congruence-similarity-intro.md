id: congruence-similarity-intro
name: Congruence and Similarity Introduction
description: Explore triangle congruence conditions (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS), similarity concepts, scale factors, and their applications to real-world scale drawings and maps
grade: 7
ages:
  - 12
  - 13
focus: Plane geometry - Congruence conditions, similarity concepts, and scale relationships
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Understand and apply triangle congruence conditions (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS) to determine when triangles are congruent
  - Distinguish between congruent figures (same shape and size) and similar figures (same shape, different size)
  - Calculate and use scale factors to determine corresponding lengths in similar figures
  - Construct congruent triangles using specified congruence criteria
  - Apply congruence and similarity concepts to solve problems involving maps, scale drawings, and real-world measurements
  - Identify corresponding sides and angles in congruent and similar figures
  - Verify congruence using appropriate criteria and justify classifications with mathematical reasoning
prerequisites:
  - triangles-quadrilaterals
  - geometric-shapes-2d
real_world_context: Congruence and similarity are fundamental to mapmaking (scale factors determine how much real distances are reduced on paper), architectural design (blueprints use scale drawings to represent buildings), engineering (miniature models maintain similarity to full-size designs), photography (enlargement and reduction of images), computer graphics (scaling and transforming shapes), geology (mineral crystal forms and congruent angles), and navigation (understanding scale on nautical and topographic maps). Grade 7 students develop the ability to work with scale drawings and understand how measurements transform under similarity, skills essential for technical fields and mathematical reasoning.
problem_types:
  - Congruence criterion
  - Similarity identification
  - Scale factor
  - Corresponding parts
  - Construction tasks
  - Scale drawings
  - Proportions setup
  - Verification reasoning
  - Missing information
  - Distinguishing concepts
age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Focus on foundational understanding with visual identification of congruent shapes
    - Emphasize SSS and SAS as the most intuitive criteria
    - Use simple numerical values (whole numbers, simple fractions)
    - Focus on scale factors with whole number values (2, 3, 0.5) before introducing decimals
    - Use concrete scale drawing applications (maps with obvious landmarks)
    - Less emphasis on formal proofs; more emphasis on verification through measurement
    - Provide more visual support and diagrams
  13:
    - Apply all four triangle congruence criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS) and HL for right triangles
    - Explain WHY different criteria work with mathematical reasoning
    - Work with scale factors as decimals, fractions, and ratios
    - Include problems requiring setup of proportion equations
    - Distinguish between similarity and congruence explicitly
    - Use formal notation (△ABC ≅ △DEF, scale factor k)
    - Include more complex real-world applications with justification and reasoning
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Provide all necessary measurements for congruence determination
    - Use obvious visual correspondence (shapes in similar orientations)
    - Focus on one congruence criterion per task
    - Use simple numerical values (whole numbers, common fractions)
    - Apply scale factors in straightforward contexts
    - Less emphasis on proof or justification; more on identification
  medium:
    - Provide measurements requiring reasoning to apply criteria (e.g., recognizing included angle)
    - Include shapes in different orientations requiring mental rotation
    - Combine two concepts (e.g., identify criterion AND calculate unknown side)
    - Use varied numerical values (decimals, uncommon fractions, values requiring calculation)
    - Apply scale factors in multi-step problems
    - Include both forward and reverse problem structures
  hard:
    - Provide incomplete information; require determining what's missing
    - Use challenging orientation changes (multiple rotations/reflections)
    - Combine multiple congruence criteria or similarity concepts
    - Work with complex numerical relationships (scale factors like 2.5 or 3/4)
    - Apply scale factors with unit conversion or scale notation (1:50,000)
    - Require written justification of reasoning
    - Include problems where congruence/similarity is not immediately obvious
    - Apply to complex real-world contexts requiring interpretation
