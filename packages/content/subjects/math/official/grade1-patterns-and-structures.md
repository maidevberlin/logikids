# Patterns and Structures

Generate tasks that help first-grade students recognize, continue, create, and describe patterns using shapes, colors, numbers, and everyday objects.

## Core Task Variations

Create diverse problem types that test pattern understanding from different angles:

1. **Pattern Continuation**: Present a pattern sequence and ask students to identify what comes next (or what fills a gap in the middle)
2. **Pattern Identification**: Show multiple sequences and ask which one follows a specific rule or which ones are patterns versus random arrangements
3. **Pattern Creation**: Ask students to create their own pattern following given rules (e.g., "make a pattern using two shapes" or "create a pattern with three colors")
4. **Pattern Rule Description**: Present a pattern and ask students to describe the rule in their own words or identify the repeating unit
5. **Error Detection**: Show a pattern with one element that breaks the rule and ask students to find and correct the mistake
6. **Pattern Matching**: Present a pattern rule and ask students to identify which visual sequence matches that rule from multiple options
7. **Growing Patterns**: Introduce simple patterns that grow (like stair steps or tower heights) and ask what comes next
8. **Pattern Translation**: Show the same pattern in different representations (shapes vs. colors vs. sounds) and ask students to recognize they're the same pattern
9. **Pattern Completion**: Present a pattern with missing elements in various positions (beginning, middle, or end) and ask students to fill them in
10. **Pattern Comparison**: Compare two different patterns and ask what's similar or different about their rules

## Visual Representation Guidelines

For pattern tasks, use visual representations that are age-appropriate:

- **Simple Shapes**: circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, stars, hearts
- **Colors**: primary colors (red, blue, yellow) and basic secondary colors (green, orange, purple)
- **Size Variations**: big/small, tall/short, long/short
- **Orientation**: upright/sideways, left/right facing
- **Common Objects**: animals, fruits, toys, weather symbols, everyday items children recognize

Describe patterns using clear visual elements. For example, specify "a repeating pattern of circle-square-circle-square" or "a growing pattern where each row has one more star than the previous row" without providing actual code or graphics.

## Pattern Complexity Scaffolding by Age

Adjust pattern complexity based on {{age}}:

**Age 6 (beginning of Grade 1)**:
- Simple AB patterns (two-element repetition like red-blue-red-blue)
- Patterns with clear visual differences (distinct shapes or strongly contrasting colors)
- Short sequences (4-6 elements shown)
- Patterns using familiar, concrete objects
- One attribute varying at a time (only shape OR only color, not both)

**Age 7 (end of Grade 1)**:
- ABC and AAB patterns (three-element or more complex repetition)
- Patterns with multiple attributes (shape AND color changing)
- Longer sequences (6-10 elements)
- Simple growing patterns (adding one element each time)
- Patterns with numbers (counting by 2s, counting by 5s in simple ranges)
- Abstract pattern rules (not just visual, but also conceptual like "odd-even")

## Difficulty Levels by {{difficulty}}

**Easy**:
- Two-element repeating patterns (AB pattern)
- Only one attribute changes (shape, color, or size)
- Pattern rule is obvious and highly regular
- Continuation requires identifying the next 1-2 elements
- Visual patterns only (no number patterns)

**Medium**:
- Three-element repeating patterns (ABC, AAB, ABB patterns)
- Two attributes change simultaneously (shape and color)
- Pattern contains a gap in the middle to fill
- Simple growing patterns (add one each time)
- Basic number patterns (skip counting by 2s or 5s)

**Hard**:
- Complex repeating patterns (AABB, ABCD, or irregular but logical patterns)
- Multiple attributes changing (shape, color, and size)
- Growing patterns with increasing increments
- Pattern rules that need verbal description
- Creating patterns from verbal rules rather than visual examples
- Identifying broken patterns and explaining why

## Number Pattern Guidance

When incorporating number patterns:

- **Skip Counting Patterns**: counting by 2s (2, 4, 6, 8...), counting by 5s (5, 10, 15, 20...), counting by 10s (10, 20, 30...)
- **Counting Backwards**: simple descending sequences within the number range 1-20
- **Odd/Even Patterns**: alternating between odd and even numbers in simple ranges
- **Growing Number Patterns**: each number increases by the same amount (1, 2, 3... or 2, 4, 6...)

Describe how to vary the starting point, the increment, and the range based on student age and difficulty level.

## Context and Real-World Connections

Connect patterns to contexts first-graders encounter:

- **Nature**: leaf arrangements, flower petals, animal markings, seasons
- **Home**: tile floors, wallpaper, clothing patterns, table settings
- **School**: classroom decorations, calendar patterns, daily routines
- **Music**: rhythmic patterns, repeating melodies
- **Movement**: dance steps, clapping patterns, playground games
- **Art**: bead patterns, painting designs, building blocks

Vary contexts to maintain engagement and show patterns exist everywhere. Describe the context type rather than specific details.

## Language and Vocabulary

Use age-appropriate language for Grade 1:

- **Simple Terms**: "comes next", "repeating", "again and again", "the rule"
- **Pattern Vocabulary**: pattern, repeat, sequence, next, before, after, same, different
- **Descriptive Words**: first, second, third, last
- **Action Words**: continue, create, find, match, describe, fill in

Tasks should be phrased simply with clear, direct questions. Avoid complex sentence structures or abstract terminology.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do NOT create tasks that:
- Require reading complex text (Grade 1 reading skills are still developing)
- Use numbers beyond the typical range for this age (keep within 1-20, occasionally to 30)
- Present patterns that are too long or complex to hold in working memory
- Rely on cultural knowledge not universally accessible to 6-7 year olds
- Use abstract symbols or representations without visual support
- Assume fine motor skills for drawing complex shapes (if creation tasks involve drawing)

## Numerical Variation Principles

When incorporating numbers or counts in pattern tasks:

- **Starting Points**: vary widely (don't always start at 1 or 0)
- **Pattern Length**: range from 4 elements (simple) to 12 elements (challenging)
- **Number of Elements in Core Pattern**: alternate between 2-element, 3-element, and 4-element repeating units
- **Growth Rates**: for growing patterns, vary the increment (add 1, add 2, occasionally add 5 or 10)
- **Number Range**: primarily 1-20 for age 6, expanding to 1-30 or beyond for age 7 or harder tasks

Randomize these parameters to ensure each task feels fresh and different.

## Assessment and Feedback Considerations

Structure tasks to allow multiple entry points:

- **Visual Recognition**: can be answered by pattern matching even without fully articulating the rule
- **Verbal Description**: extension questions can ask students to explain the pattern rule
- **Multiple Representations**: show the same pattern concept in different formats to assess deep understanding

When providing hints (for the hint system):
1. **First hint**: Draw attention to the repeating unit ("Look at the first few shapes - do you see which ones repeat?")
2. **Second hint**: Highlight the pattern rule more explicitly ("The pattern is: circle, square, circle, square...")
3. **Third hint**: Show the next step directly with explanation ("After square comes circle, because that's how the pattern repeats")

## Task Format Recommendations

Most appropriate task formats for this concept:

- **Multiple Choice**: "What comes next in this pattern?" with 3-4 visual options
- **Gap Fill**: "Fill in the missing shape in this pattern: ○ □ ○ __ ○ □"
- **True/False**: "Is this a pattern? Yes or No" followed by a sequence
- **Matching**: Match pattern rules to pattern sequences
- **Creation Tasks**: "Create a pattern using these shapes: ○ □ △" (open-ended)

Vary formats to maintain interest and assess different aspects of pattern understanding.

## Final Reminder

Focus on the PROCESS of pattern thinking, not memorization. Tasks should encourage students to:
- Look for what repeats or changes systematically
- Make predictions based on observed rules
- Recognize that patterns help organize and understand the world
- Develop visual discrimination and sequencing skills
- Build foundational skills for algebraic thinking (though not explicitly named at this level)
