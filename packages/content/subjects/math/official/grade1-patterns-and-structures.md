id: grade1-patterns-and-structures
name: Patterns and Structures
description: Identifying, continuing, and creating patterns with shapes, colors, and numbers
grade: 1
ages: [6, 7]
focus: Pattern recognition and structural thinking
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize repeating patterns with shapes, colors, and objects
  - Continue given patterns logically using the pattern rule
  - Create own patterns with various materials and representations
  - Describe pattern rules verbally and recognize pattern elements
  - Identify simple growing patterns and predict the next element
prerequisites: []
real_world_context: Patterns appear everywhere in daily life - in nature (flower petals, animal stripes), architecture (tiles, fences), clothing (fabric designs), music (rhythms), and help develop mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills. Aligned with German KMK federal standards for Grade 1 mathematics.
problem_types:
  - Pattern continuation
  - Pattern identification
  - Pattern creation
  - Rule description
  - Error detection
  - Pattern matching
  - Growing patterns
  - Pattern translation
  - Pattern completion
  - Pattern comparison
age_guidelines:
  6:
    - Simple AB patterns (two-element repetition like red-blue-red-blue)
    - Patterns with clear visual differences (distinct shapes or strongly contrasting colors)
    - Short sequences (4-6 elements shown)
    - Patterns using familiar, concrete objects
    - One attribute varying at a time (only shape OR only color, not both)
  7:
    - ABC and AAB patterns (three-element or more complex repetition)
    - Patterns with multiple attributes (shape AND color changing)
    - Longer sequences (6-10 elements)
    - Simple growing patterns (adding one element each time)
    - Patterns with numbers (counting by 2s, counting by 5s in simple ranges)
    - Abstract pattern rules (not just visual, but also conceptual like "odd-even")
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Two-element repeating patterns (AB pattern)
    - Only one attribute changes (shape, color, or size)
    - Pattern rule is obvious and highly regular
    - Continuation requires identifying the next 1-2 elements
    - Visual patterns only (no number patterns)
  medium:
    - Three-element repeating patterns (ABC, AAB, ABB patterns)
    - Two attributes change simultaneously (shape and color)
    - Pattern contains a gap in the middle to fill
    - Simple growing patterns (add one each time)
    - Basic number patterns (skip counting by 2s or 5s)
  hard:
    - Complex repeating patterns (AABB, ABCD, or irregular but logical patterns)
    - Multiple attributes changing (shape, color, and size)
    - Growing patterns with increasing increments
    - Pattern rules that need verbal description
    - Creating patterns from verbal rules rather than visual examples
    - Identifying broken patterns and explaining why

version_notes: Migrated from prose-based format to frontmatter-based format. Condensed problem types and extracted age/difficulty guidelines from original prose sections.
