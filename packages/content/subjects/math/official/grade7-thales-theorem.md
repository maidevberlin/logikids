difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify right angles in simple semicircle configurations with labeled points

    - Solve complex problems requiring identification of which circle theorem applies
prerequisites:
  - grade6-geometric-constructions
  - grade6-angles-advanced
real_world_context:
  - Architects use the semicircle property to design arched doorways and windows, ensuring structural elements meet at right angles
  - Engineers apply Thales' theorem when designing curved roads and railway tracks to ensure perpendicular intersections with access roads
  - Surveyors use the tangent property to determine accessible measurement points when direct measurement is impossible
  - Astronomers historically used Thales' theorem to calculate distances to celestial objects using angular measurements
  - Navigation systems use circle geometry and tangent lines to calculate optimal routes around obstacles
  - Woodworkers verifying right angles using the semicircle method with a compass
  - Sailors determining perpendicular headings from circular navigation charts
  - Camera operators setting up crane shots along semicircular paths
  - Watch designers ensuring hour markers form right angles to the center
  - Playground equipment featuring semicircular climbing structures with perpendicular supports
  - Archaeologists reconstructing circular ancient structures from partial remains
  - Pool designers planning curved edges that meet pool walls at right angles
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid angles larger than 180 degrees or reflex angles in problems
  - Don't introduce circle theorems beyond Thales and tangent properties
  - Avoid constructions requiring precise angle measurements without tools
  - Don't combine Thales' theorem with trigonometry or coordinate geometry
  - Avoid diagrams where the diameter or center point is not clearly marked
