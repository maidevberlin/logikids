# Division with Remainder

Generate tasks that help students understand division when numbers don't divide evenly, and interpret remainders in context.

## Task Variations

### 1. Basic Division with Remainder
Straightforward division problems:
- Calculate ${{dividend}} \div {{divisor}}$ and express as quotient with remainder
- Use dividends from 10-50 and divisors from 2-9
- Present in different notations: "$25 \div 4 = ?$" or "$25 : 4 = ?$"
- Ask for both parts: "What is the quotient? What is the remainder?"
- Example: "$17 \div 3 = 5$ remainder $2$"

### 2. Sharing Problems (Fair Distribution)
Apply division to real-world sharing:
- "{{num}} candies are shared equally among {{divisor}} children. How many does each child get? How many are left over?"
- "A teacher has {{num}} pencils to distribute equally to {{divisor}} students. How many pencils per student? Are there any left?"
- Use relatable contexts: cookies, stickers, toys, books
- Example: "23 cookies shared among 4 friends. Each gets 5 cookies, with 3 left over."

### 3. Grouping Problems
Divide items into equal groups:
- "You have {{num}} apples and want to put {{divisor}} apples in each basket. How many full baskets can you make? How many apples are left?"
- "A box holds {{divisor}} toys. You have {{num}} toys. How many full boxes? How many toys won't fit?"
- Emphasize the difference between sharing and grouping
- Example: "28 students, 6 per team. How many complete teams? How many students left?"

### 4. Remainder Interpretation
Understand what the remainder means in context:
- Present scenarios where remainder matters differently:
  - "15 people, 4 per car. How many cars needed?" (round UP: need 4 cars)
  - "15 cookies, 4 per child. How many complete servings?" (quotient only: 3 servings)
  - "15 marbles, groups of 4. How many left over?" (remainder only: 3 marbles)
- Ask: "Does the remainder mean we need one more, or that some are left over?"

### 5. Missing Number Problems
Solve for unknowns in division:
- Given quotient and remainder, find dividend: "? $\div 5 = 7$ remainder $2$"
- Given dividend and remainder, find divisor: "$23 \div ? = 4$ remainder $3$"
- Create word problems: "After sharing equally among 6 friends, each got 4 cookies with 2 left. How many cookies in total?"
- Example: If $n \div 7 = 8$ remainder $3$, then $n = 7 \times 8 + 3 = 59$

### 6. Checking Division with Multiplication
Verify division using multiplication:
- "If $29 \div 6 = 4$ remainder $5$, check: $6 \times 4 + 5 = ?$"
- Teach the relationship: dividend $=$ (divisor $\times$ quotient) $+$ remainder
- Create fill-in exercises:
  - $31 \div 5 = 6$ R $1$
  - Check: $5 \times 6 + 1 = ?$
- Present incomplete checks for students to complete

### 7. Division with Tens Numbers
Work with larger dividends:
- Divide numbers like 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 by single digits
- "$65 \div 8 = ?$ remainder $?$"
- "$74 \div 9 = ?$ remainder $?$"
- Use contexts like: "85 students divided into 9 equal groups"
- Example: $52 \div 7 = 7$ remainder $3$ because $7 \times 7 = 49$ and $52 - 49 = 3$

### 8. Comparison and Pattern Problems
Identify patterns in remainders:
- "Find the remainders when dividing consecutive numbers by 5:"
  - $10 \div 5 =$ ? R ?
  - $11 \div 5 =$ ? R ?
  - $12 \div 5 =$ ? R ?
  - $13 \div 5 =$ ? R ?
  - $14 \div 5 =$ ? R ?
- "What pattern do you notice?"
- Create tables:

| Dividend | $\div 4$ | Quotient | Remainder |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 20       | $=$      | 5        | 0         |
| 21       | $=$      | 5        | 1         |
| 22       | $=$      | ?        | ?         |
| 23       | $=$      | ?        | ?         |

### 9. Multi-Step Word Problems
Combine division with other operations:
- "A bakery made 75 muffins. They pack 6 muffins per box. How many full boxes? If each box costs $8, how much for all full boxes?"
- "48 children go on a field trip. Each van holds 7 children. How many vans needed? If we need one adult per van, how many adults?"
- Include planning scenarios that require rounding up
- Example: "You have $50. Books cost $7 each. How many can you buy? How much money left?"

## Difficulty Scaling

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy):**
- Small dividends (10-25)
- Small divisors (2-5)
- Direct division notation
- Simple sharing contexts
- Example: $14 \div 3 = 4$ remainder $2$

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium):**
- Larger dividends (25-50)
- All single-digit divisors (2-9)
- Word problems with interpretation
- Checking with multiplication
- Example: "37 stickers, 5 per page. How many full pages? How many left?"

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard):**
- Dividends with tens (50-99)
- Missing number problems
- Remainder interpretation (round up vs. leftover)
- Multi-step problems
- Pattern recognition
- Example: "? $\div 8 = 9$ remainder $5$. What number divided by 8 gives quotient 9 and remainder 5?"
