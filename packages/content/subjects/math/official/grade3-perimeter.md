name: Perimeter
description: Calculating the perimeter of shapes by adding side lengths
grade: 3
focus: Measurement and geometry
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand perimeter as the total distance around a shape
  - Calculate perimeter by adding all side lengths
  - Measure sides of shapes and compute perimeter
  - Recognize that shapes with the same area can have different perimeters
  - Estimate perimeter before calculating
problem_types:
  - Rectangle perimeter
  - Square perimeter
  - Triangle perimeter
  - Irregular polygon perimeter
  - Missing side length
  - Perimeter from measurements
  - Shape comparison
  - Perimeter estimation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Squares and rectangles with all sides given
    - Side lengths less than 20 units
    - Simple shapes with 3-4 sides
  medium:
    - Irregular shapes with 4-5 sides
    - Some sides require measurement or calculation
    - Side lengths up to 50 units
  hard:
    - Complex shapes with 6 sides
    - Finding missing side lengths using given perimeter
    - Multi-step problems combining measurement and calculation
prerequisites:
  - grade3-area
  - grade3-written-addition-and-subtraction
real_world_context:
  - Measuring the length of fencing needed around a garden or playground
  - Calculating the amount of ribbon needed to go around the edge of a birthday card
  - Finding the total distance of a walking path around a park or sports field
  - Determining how much trim or border material is needed for a picture frame or room
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using formulas like P = 2(l+w); focus on adding individual sides
  - Don't use side lengths greater than 100 for grade 3 students
  - Avoid shapes with more than 6 sides
  - Don't confuse perimeter with area in problem statements
  - Avoid problems requiring multiplication or division of side lengths
