name: Data Collection and Charts
description: Collecting, organizing, and representing data using tables, bar charts, pictographs, and line graphs
grade: 5
ages:
  - 10
  - 11
focus: Data representation and interpretation
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Collect and organize data using tally lists and tables
  - Create and interpret bar charts and column diagrams
  - Create and interpret pictographs and pictorial representations
  - Create and interpret line graphs for temporal data
  - Compare data sets using visual representations
  - Draw simple conclusions from data displays
  - Understand advantages and disadvantages of different chart types
prerequisites:
  - counting-and-tally
real_world_context: Data collection and visualization are essential in real-world contexts like surveys, weather tracking, sports statistics, sales data, environmental monitoring, and daily observations. Different chart types serve different purposes in communicating information effectively.
problem_types:
  - Data Organization
  - Table Creation
  - Chart Translation
  - Direct Reading
  - Comparisons
  - Trend Analysis
  - Scale Selection
  - Data Decisions
age_guidelines:
  10:
    - School surveys, favorite items, simple counts with familiar settings
    - Bar charts and pictographs with symbols equal to 1 unit
    - Small data sets (3-5 categories, under 20 points), scales by 1s
    - Read charts, identify most/least, create simple tables
    - Clear and supportive language with visual references
  11:
    - Community surveys, classroom statistics, measurements across time
    - All main chart types including simple line graphs
    - Medium data sets (4-7 categories), scales by 1s, 2s, 5s, or 10s
    - Create charts from tables, comparative questions, scale selection
    - Provide scale options or grid guidance as scaffolding
  12:
    - Real-world scenarios, multi-step analysis, abstract patterns
    - All chart types including multi-series comparisons
    - Larger data sets (5-10 categories), diverse scales
    - Organize raw data, analyze trends, make predictions
    - Connect patterns to real-world implications
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Reading pre-drawn charts with clear scales
    - Identifying most/least common categories
    - Simple value comparisons between two categories
    - Bar charts and pictographs with symbols equal to 1
    - Small data sets with 3-5 categories
    - School-based familiar contexts
  medium:
    - Creating bar charts from organized data
    - Choosing appropriate scales (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s)
    - Reading pictographs with symbols equal to 2, 5, or 10
    - Interpreting partial symbols
    - Answering how many more/fewer questions
    - Medium data sets with 4-7 categories
    - Community and measurement contexts
  hard:
    - Creating charts from raw unorganized data
    - Determining optimal scales for diverse ranges
    - Interpreting double bar charts
    - Analyzing multiple lines on same graph
    - Using charts to identify patterns and trends
    - Making data-driven predictions and decisions
    - Large data sets with 5-10 categories
    - Real-world decision-making contexts

version_notes: Migrated from prose format to structured frontmatter format. Extracted problem types, age-specific guidelines, and difficulty-based scaffolding from original content.
