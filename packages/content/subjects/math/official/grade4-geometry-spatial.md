id: grade4-geometry-spatial
name: Geometry and Spatial Reasoning
description: Properties of 2D and 3D shapes; symmetry and lines; spatial visualization; nets of geometric solids; parallel and perpendicular relationships
grade: 4
focus: Geometric properties and spatial thinking
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and describe properties of 2D shapes (triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons)
  - Recognize and describe properties of 3D shapes (cubes, cuboids, pyramids, cylinders)
  - Identify lines of symmetry in 2D shapes and create symmetrical figures
  - Recognize and draw parallel and perpendicular lines
  - Visualize and construct nets of simple 3D shapes
  - Apply spatial reasoning to solve orientation and visualization problems
problem_types:
  - Shape property identification
  - Symmetry line finding
  - Net matching
  - Parallel and perpendicular recognition
  - 3D shape visualization
  - Shape sorting by properties
  - Net construction
  - Spatial transformation
  - Missing view identification
  - Symmetry completion
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Common shapes with obvious properties (squares, cubes, equilateral triangles)
    - Single line of symmetry in simple shapes
    - Matching complete nets to familiar 3D shapes
  medium:
    - Variety of shapes including irregular polygons and combined shapes
    - Multiple lines of symmetry or no symmetry
    - Constructing nets or identifying incomplete nets
  hard:
    - Complex spatial reasoning with rotations or multiple transformations
    - Non-standard orientations or overlapping shapes
    - Reasoning about 3D shapes from 2D views or vice versa
prerequisites:
  - grade3-advanced-geometry
real_world_context:
  - Building with blocks or construction toys to understand 3D shapes
  - Finding symmetry in nature (leaves, butterflies) and architecture
  - Unfolding boxes and packages to see nets
  - Map reading and understanding different views of buildings
  - Recognizing parallel lines on roads and perpendicular corners in rooms
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid technical terminology beyond grade level (vertices, edges, faces are OK)
  - Don't require angle measurement or precise geometric drawing
  - Avoid shapes with more than 8 sides unless clearly illustrated
  - Don't combine multiple unrelated geometric concepts in one problem
  - Avoid 3D visualizations requiring advanced perspective understanding
