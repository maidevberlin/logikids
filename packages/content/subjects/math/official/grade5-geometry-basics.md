id: grade5-geometry-basics
name: Basic Geometric Elements
description: Points, lines, rays, segments, parallel and perpendicular lines, and basic geometric notation
grade: 5
focus: Fundamental geometric elements and relationships
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and name points, lines, line segments, and rays
  - Use correct geometric notation (AB, ray AB, line AB)
  - Identify parallel lines and their properties
  - Identify perpendicular lines and their properties
  - Recognize intersecting lines and intersection points
  - Draw geometric figures using ruler
problem_types:
  - Figure identification
  - Notation practice
  - Parallel line recognition
  - Perpendicular identification
  - Drawing tasks
  - Relationship analysis
  - Real-world applications
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify single elements (one point, one line, one ray)
    - Basic notation with two points
    - Obvious parallel or perpendicular lines
  medium:
    - Multiple elements in one diagram
    - Relationships between several lines
    - Mixed notation tasks
  hard:
    - Complex figures with many elements
    - Combining multiple geometric concepts
    - Analyzing multiple relationships simultaneously
prerequisites:
  - grade4-geometry-spatial
real_world_context:
  - Road intersections and railroad tracks showing parallel and perpendicular lines
  - Building structures and architecture using geometric elements
  - Sports fields and courts with marked lines and boundaries
  - Map reading and navigation using straight paths and crossings
  - Power lines and telephone poles creating parallel line patterns
  - Ladder rungs as parallel segments connected to side rails
  - Floor tiles arranged in perpendicular grid patterns
  - Window frames with horizontal and vertical bars
  - Bridge cables radiating from towers as rays from a point
  - Airplane contrails creating intersecting lines in the sky
  - Crosswalk stripes as parallel line segments
  - Laser beams in science fiction movies as rays of light
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid angle measurements (separate concept for Grade 5)
  - Don't include coordinate geometry or grids
  - Avoid complex constructions requiring compass or advanced tools
  - Don't use 3D representations or perspective drawings
  - Avoid more than 5 distinct elements in a single figure
