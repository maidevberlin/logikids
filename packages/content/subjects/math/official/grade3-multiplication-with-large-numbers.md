# Multiplication with Large Numbers

Create tasks that help students multiply larger numbers by breaking them down using the distributive property and working with multiples of ten.

## Problem Variations

**Variation 1: Multiplying Multiples of Ten**
Calculate: ${{tens_number}} \times {{single_digit}}$

Example: $40 \times 6 = ?$

Students should recognize that $40 \times 6 = (4 \times 10) \times 6 = 4 \times 6 \times 10 = 24 \times 10 = 240$

**Variation 2: Breaking Down Two-Digit Numbers**
Use the distributive property to calculate: ${{two_digit_number}} \times {{single_digit}}$

Example: $27 \times 5 = (20 \times 5) + (7 \times 5) = 100 + 35 = 135$

Show the breakdown:
$${{two_digit_number}} \times {{single_digit}} = ({{tens_part}} \times {{single_digit}}) + ({{ones_part}} \times {{single_digit}})$$

**Variation 3: Real-World Shopping Problems**
A toy store sells action figures for ${{price}}$ each. How much do ${{quantity}}$ action figures cost?

Example: Each notebook costs $15. How much do 6 notebooks cost?

Solution: $15 \times 6 = (10 \times 6) + (5 \times 6) = 60 + 30 = 90$ euros

**Variation 4: Arrays and Groups**
There are ${{rows}}$ rows of chairs with ${{chairs_per_row}}$ chairs in each row. How many chairs are there in total?

Example: In a theater, there are 8 rows with 24 chairs in each row.

$$24 \times 8 = (20 \times 8) + (4 \times 8) = 160 + 32 = 192 \text{ chairs}$$

**Variation 5: Comparison Tasks**
Compare these two calculations without computing them fully first:
- ${{number_a}} \times {{multiplier}}$
- ${{number_b}} \times {{multiplier}}$

Which product is larger? Explain your reasoning.

**Variation 6: Missing Factor Problems**
${{tens_multiple}} \times ? = {{product}}$

Example: $30 \times ? = 210$

Students should think: "What times 3 gives 21? That's 7. So $30 \times 7 = 210$"

**Variation 7: Multi-Step Packaging Problems**
A bakery packs ${{items_per_box}}$ cookies in each box. They need to pack ${{number_of_boxes}}$ boxes. How many cookies do they need?

Example: Each box holds 18 cookies, and they need to fill 5 boxes.

$$18 \times 5 = (10 \times 5) + (8 \times 5) = 50 + 40 = 90 \text{ cookies}$$

**Variation 8: Pattern Recognition**
Complete the pattern:
- $10 \times {{digit}} = {{result_1}}$
- $20 \times {{digit}} = {{result_2}}$
- $30 \times {{digit}} = ?$
- ${{tens_a}} \times {{digit}} = ?$

Students observe how products increase by the same amount each time.
