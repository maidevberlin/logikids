description: Half-written methods for multiplication, multiplying by 10 and 100, and division with remainder
grade: 3
focus: Multiplication and division strategies
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Apply half-written multiplication methods for single-digit times two-digit numbers
  - Multiply whole numbers by 10 and 100 using place value understanding
  - Perform division with remainder and interpret the remainder in context
  - Use the relationship between multiplication and division to check answers
  - Solve word problems involving multiplication and division with remainders
problem_types:
  - Half-written multiplication
  - Multiplying by 10
  - Multiplying by 100
  - Division with remainder
  - Remainder interpretation
  - Inverse checking
  - Missing factor
  - Scaling problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-digit multiplied by multiples of 10 (e.g., 3 × 20)
    - Multiplying single-digit numbers by 10 or 100
    - Division by single-digit divisors with remainders under 5
  medium:
    - Single-digit times two-digit numbers using half-written methods
    - Two-digit numbers multiplied by 10 or 100
    - Division with single-digit divisors and any remainder
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining multiplication and division
    - Word problems requiring remainder interpretation
    - Finding missing factors when product and one factor are given
prerequisites:
  - grade2-introduction-to-multiplication
real_world_context:
  - Calculating total items when buying multiple packages of the same product
  - Sharing items equally among friends and determining leftover items
  - Scaling recipes up by multiplying ingredients by 10 or 100
  - Organizing students into equal groups and determining remaining students
  - Converting between different units by multiplying or dividing by 10
  - A pirate captain dividing treasure coins among crew with some left over
  - Packing oranges into bags of ten for a market stall
  - Distributing art supplies equally among tables with extras remaining
  - A coach forming relay teams and deciding what to do with remaining runners
  - Calculating how many complete rows can be made from a set of chairs

  - A toy factory packing items into boxes of ten for shipping
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid multiplication problems requiring products above 1000
  - Don't use divisors larger than 10
  - Avoid fractions or decimal notation for remainders
  - Don't combine multiple operations beyond one multiplication and one division
  - Avoid word problems with unfamiliar contexts for 8-9 year olds
