name: Addition and Subtraction to 100
description: Adding and subtracting numbers within 100 using mental strategies, with and without regrouping, and solving multi-step word problems
grade: 2
focus: Extended arithmetic operations with place value
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Add two-digit numbers mentally using place value strategies
  - Subtract two-digit numbers with and without regrouping
  - Apply mental calculation strategies such as decomposing numbers by place value
  - Solve addition and subtraction problems that require regrouping across tens
  - Use the hundred chart and number line as tools for calculation
  - Understand inverse relationships between addition and subtraction operations
  - Solve multi-step word problems involving addition and subtraction within 100
problem_types:
  - Two-digit addition
  - Two-digit subtraction
  - Missing addend
  - Regrouping problems
  - Number line calculation
  - Hundred chart navigation
  - Multi-step word problem
  - Inverse operation
  - Comparison problem
  - Error detection
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Two-digit numbers without regrouping (e.g., 23 + 45, 67 - 32)
    - Adding or subtracting multiples of 10 (e.g., 40 + 30, 80 - 20)
    - Single-step operations with visual support references acceptable
  medium:
    - Two-digit addition or subtraction requiring regrouping once
    - Missing addend problems with two-digit numbers
    - Word problems requiring one calculation step with contextual interpretation
  hard:
    - Multiple regrouping steps or complex decomposition required
    - Multi-step word problems requiring planning and two operations
    - Problems combining different strategies or inverse operations
real_world_context:
  - Calculating money amounts when shopping or saving allowance
  - Determining distances traveled or remaining on a journey
  - Counting collections such as trading cards, stickers, or marbles
  - Solving problems about classroom attendance or absences
  - Calculating scores or points in games and sports activities
  - A wizard mixing potion ingredients by adding or removing quantities
  - Tracking book pages read and pages remaining in a chapter book
  - A zookeeper counting animals after some are moved to other exhibits
  - Adding up points earned across multiple levels in a video game
  - Figuring out how many more laps to swim to reach a goal
  - A baker calculating rolls baked minus rolls sold during the day
  - Planning party supplies needed when some guests cancel
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid numbers larger than 100
  - Don't use negative numbers or results below zero
  - Avoid problems requiring multiplication or division knowledge
  - Don't include more than two operations in a single problem
  - Avoid fractions, decimals, or abstract scenarios unfamiliar to 7-8 year olds
