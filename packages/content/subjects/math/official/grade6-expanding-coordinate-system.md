# Expanding Coordinate System

Create tasks where {{child_name}} works with all four quadrants of the coordinate system including negative coordinates appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Plotting Points with Negative Coordinates**: Plot points in all four quadrants. "Plot the point $({{-3}}, {{4}})$" or "Plot $({{2}}, {{-5}})$". Vary the quadrant: I (both positive), II (negative x, positive y), III (both negative), IV (positive x, negative y). Use coordinates in range {{-10}} to {{10}}.

2. **Reading Coordinates**: Show a point on a grid and ask for its coordinates. "What are the coordinates of point A?" Place points in all four quadrants. Include points on axes: $({{0}}, {{3}})$ or $({{-4}}, {{0}})$.

3. **Identifying Quadrants**: Ask which quadrant a point is in, or give conditions. "In which quadrant is the point $({{-5}}, {{-3}})$?" or "Point P has a positive x-coordinate and negative y-coordinate. Which quadrant is it in?" Include axis cases (between quadrants).

4. **Distance from Origin**: Calculate or compare distances. "How far is the point $({{3}}, {{4}})$ from the origin?" Use Pythagorean theorem: $d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, or simpler: count horizontal and vertical distances separately for Manhattan distance.

5. **Reflections across Axes**: Reflect points across x-axis or y-axis. "Reflect $({{4}}, {{3}})$ across the {{x-axis/y-axis}}. What are the new coordinates?" Across x-axis: $(x, -y)$. Across y-axis: $(-x, y)$. Include multiple reflections.

6. **Simple Linear Functions**: Plot points from equations and draw lines. "Complete the table for $y = {{2}}x + {{1}}$ and plot the points." Give $x$ values like ${{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}}$ and ask students to calculate $y$, plot, and draw the line.

7. **Horizontal and Vertical Lines**: Identify or draw special lines. "Draw the line $x = {{-3}}$" (vertical line through $x = -3$) or "Draw the line $y = {{2}}$" (horizontal line through $y = 2$). Ask for equations of given horizontal/vertical lines.

8. **Geometric Shapes on Grid**: Plot vertices and identify shapes. "Plot points $({{-2}}, {{3}})$, $({{2}}, {{3}})$, $({{2}}, {{-1}})$, $({{-2}}, {{-1}})$. Connect them. What shape is formed?" Calculate perimeter or area of shapes on coordinate grid.

Use clear SVG coordinate grids showing all four quadrants with axes labeled and numbered (typically {{-10}} to {{10}}). Mark origin $(0, 0)$ clearly. Label quadrants I, II, III, IV. Include grid lines for easy plotting.

For linear functions, present in table form:

| $x$ | $y = 2x - 1$ |
|---|---|
| $-2$ | ? |
| $0$ | ? |
| $2$ | ? |

Emphasize coordinate notation: $(x, y)$ where $x$ is horizontal (left/right) and $y$ is vertical (up/down). Negative values go left (x) or down (y) from origin. Connect to real contexts: temperature over time, elevation relative to sea level, financial gains/losses.
