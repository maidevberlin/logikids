# Introduction to Percentages

Create tasks where {{child_name}} works with percentages, understanding them as hundredths and solving basic percentage problems appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Understanding Percent as Hundredths**: Convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages. "${{25}}\\% = \frac{?}{100} = ?$ (decimal)" or "Write $\frac{3}{4}$ as a percent." Use visual percentage bars. Common conversions: $25\\% = 0.25 = \frac{1}{4}$, $50\\% = 0.5 = \frac{1}{2}$, $75\\% = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$.

2. **Finding Percentage of a Number**: Calculate percentage value. "${{20}}\\%$ of ${{60}} = $ ?" Method: $0.20 \times 60 = 12$. Or: "${{35}}\\%$ of ${{80}} = $ ?" Use multiples of 5% or 10% to keep calculations manageable. Include contexts: "A ${{40}}$ euro shirt has ${{25}}\\%$ discount. How much is the discount?"

3. **Finding What Percent One Number Is of Another**: Calculate percentage rate. "${{15}}$ is what percent of ${{60}}$?" Method: $\frac{15}{60} = \frac{1}{4} = 25\\%$. Or: "${{18}}$ out of ${{24}}$ students passed. What percent passed?" Vary so answers are whole percentages or simple decimals.

4. **Finding the Whole (Base Value)**: Given percentage and part, find whole. "${{30}}\\%$ of a number is ${{12}}$. What is the number?" Method: $12 \div 0.30 = 40$. Or: "After a ${{20}}\\%$ discount, a book costs ${{16}}$ euros. What was the original price?" Use percentages like 20%, 25%, 50%.

5. **Percentage Bar Visualization**: Use or create percentage bars (100 squares). "Shade ${{40}}\\%$ of the bar" or "What percent of the bar is shaded?" Connect visual to numerical representation. Include bars divided into 10 or 20 sections for easier calculation.

6. **Discount Problems**: Calculate sale prices. "A ${{50}}$ euro jacket has a ${{30}}\\%$ discount. What is the sale price?" Two steps: find discount ($50 \times 0.30 = 15$), subtract from original ($50 - 15 = 35$). Vary discount rates ({{10-50}}%).

7. **Tax/VAT Problems**: Add tax to base price. "A toy costs ${{25}}$ euros plus ${{20}}\\%$ VAT. What is the total price?" Calculate: $25 \times 0.20 = 5$ (VAT), total = $25 + 5 = 30$ euros. Or find price before tax. Use realistic VAT rates ({{19-20}}%) or sales tax ({{5-10}}%).

8. **Percent Increase/Decrease**: Find new amounts after percentage changes. "A plant is ${{80}}$ cm tall. It grows ${{15}}\\%$. What is its new height?" Calculate: $80 \times 0.15 = 12$ cm growth, new height = $92$ cm. Include population changes, price changes, score improvements.

Present the three basic percentage formulas:
- **Percentage Value**: $\text{Part} = \text{Percent} \times \text{Whole}$ (e.g., $20\\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.20 \times 60$)
- **Percentage Rate**: $\text{Percent} = \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}$ (e.g., $\frac{15}{60} = 25\\%$)
- **Base Value**: $\text{Whole} = \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Percent}}$ (e.g., $\frac{12}{0.30} = 40$)

Use percentage bars and tables:

| Original Price | Discount Rate | Discount Amount | Sale Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| ${{60}}$ | ${{25}}\\%$ | ? | ? |

Emphasize: percent means "per hundred" or "out of 100". $50\\%$ means 50 out of 100 or $\frac{50}{100} = \frac{1}{2}$. Include both calculation and reasoning: "Does a ${{20}}\\%$ discount on a ${{50}}$ euro item give the same discount as ${{20}}\\%$ off ${{100}}$ euros? Why or why not?"
