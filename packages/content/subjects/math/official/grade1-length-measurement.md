name: Length Measurement
description: Comparing lengths, ordering objects by size, and measuring using non-standard units
grade: 1
focus: Measurement fundamentals
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Compare objects by length using terms longer, shorter, and same length
  - Order three or more objects by length from shortest to longest
  - Measure length using non-standard units like paper clips or hand spans
  - Estimate how many units long an object might be before measuring
  - Understand that the same object can have different measurements with different units
problem_types:
  - Length comparison
  - Length ordering
  - Non-standard measurement
  - Estimation and measurement
  - Unit comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Compare two objects with clear visual differences
    - Identify which of two objects is longer or shorter
    - Count units when measuring with 2-4 identical objects
  medium:
    - Order 3-4 objects by length
    - Measure objects using 3-8 non-standard units
    - Compare two measurements using the same unit
  hard:
    - Order 5+ objects by length
    - Use non-standard units to compare two different objects
    - Solve simple problems requiring measurement comparison
real_world_context:
  - Comparing heights of family members, friends, or classroom objects
  - Using hand spans or footsteps to measure classroom furniture
  - A giant measuring objects using his massive footsteps as units
  - Comparing the lengths of different toy cars or trains
  - Figuring out which pencil, crayon, or marker is longest
  - A caterpillar measuring leaves by crawling along their length
  - Comparing ribbons to see which is long enough for a gift
  - A mouse using its tail to measure cheese wheels in a pantry
  - Laying paper clips end to end to measure a book
  - A frog hopping along a log to see how many jumps it takes
  - Comparing how tall different sunflowers have grown in a garden
  - Using building blocks to measure the length of a toy dinosaur
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using standard units like centimeters or meters
  - Avoid complex word problems requiring calculations
  - Don't combine length with other measurement types
  - Avoid measuring curved or irregular shapes
  - Don't require precise numerical calculations beyond counting units
version: 1
version_notes: Split from grade1-introduction-to-measurement to separate length and time concepts
