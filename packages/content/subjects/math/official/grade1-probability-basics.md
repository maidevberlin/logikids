id: grade1-probability-basics
name: Probability Basics
description: Understanding chance and likelihood using vocabulary like certain, possible, and impossible through simple everyday situations
grade: 1
focus: Data and probability
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Use the word certain to describe events that will always happen
  - Use the word impossible to describe events that cannot happen
  - Use the word possible to describe events that might happen
  - Classify everyday events as certain, possible, or impossible
  - Compare the likelihood of two simple events
problem_types:
  - Certain or impossible
  - Event classification
  - Likelihood comparison
  - Possible outcomes
  - Real-world probability
  - True or false likelihood
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Clear certain or impossible events only (sun rises, fish flies)
    - Binary choices between obviously different likelihoods
    - Familiar everyday scenarios
  medium:
    - Include possible events alongside certain and impossible
    - Simple comparisons of more likely vs less likely
    - Events from school or home contexts
  hard:
    - Classify multiple events into three categories
    - Compare likelihood of two possible but different events
    - Simple drawing scenarios (colored balls from a bag)
real_world_context:
  - Weather predictions like whether it will rain or be sunny
  - Drawing a colored ball from a bag with different colored balls
  - Rolling a die and getting a specific number
  - Picking a card from a set of picture cards
  - Everyday events like the sun rising or a cat talking
  - A magician pulling a rabbit or a flower from a magic hat
  - Spinning a wheel at a carnival and predicting where it will land
  - Choosing a snack without looking from a mixed bowl of treats
  - Predicting if a flipped coin will show heads or tails
  - Guessing which door has a prize behind it in a game show
  - Wondering if a pet fish will swim left or right in its tank
  - Deciding if tomorrow will be a school day or weekend
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid fractions or numerical probability values
  - Don't use the terms likely and unlikely (introduced in grade 2)
  - Avoid complex multi-step probability scenarios
  - Don't combine probability with arithmetic operations
  - Avoid scenarios requiring counting of large numbers of outcomes
prerequisites:
  - grade1-patterns-and-data
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
