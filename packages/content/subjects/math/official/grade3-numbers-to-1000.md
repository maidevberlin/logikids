name: Numbers to 1000
description: Understanding place value with hundreds, tens, and ones; reading, writing, comparing, and ordering numbers; rounding; recognizing number patterns
grade: 3
focus: Place value and number sense
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand place value structure of three-digit numbers (hundreds, tens, ones)
  - Read and write numbers to 1000 in digits and words
  - Compare and order numbers to 1000 using symbols and number lines
  - Round numbers to the nearest ten or hundred
  - Identify and continue patterns in three-digit number sequences
problem_types:
  - Place value decomposition
  - Number comparison
  - Ordering sequences
  - Rounding practice
  - Number writing
  - Pattern completion
  - Missing digit puzzles
  - Number line positioning
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Numbers 100-300, clear place value patterns
    - Rounding to nearest ten only
    - Simple ascending/descending sequences
  medium:
    - Full range 0-1000, mixed patterns
    - Rounding to both tens and hundreds
    - Sequences with varying steps (not just +1, +10, +100)
  hard:
    - Numbers near boundaries (98-102, 498-502)
    - Multi-step reasoning (compare then round)
    - Complex patterns with multiple rules
real_world_context:
  - Counting money in bills and coins up to 1000 euros
  - Measuring distances in meters (playground, neighborhood walks)
  - Reading house numbers and street addresses
  - Understanding population numbers of small towns
  - Tracking pages in books or points in games
  - A librarian organizing books by catalog numbers in the hundreds
  - Counting attendance at a school assembly or community event
  - Reading odometer readings on a family car trip
  - Tracking daily step counts on a fitness tracker
  - A museum curator numbering artifacts in a collection
  - Comparing building heights measured in meters
  - Reading seat numbers at a concert hall or stadium
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid numbers above 1000 or decimal notation
  - Don't mix place value with arithmetic operations
  - Avoid ambiguous rounding (e.g., "round 250" without specifying to tens/hundreds)
  - Don't use unfamiliar contexts (stock markets, complex measurements)
  - Avoid multiple-step word problems combining several concepts
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
