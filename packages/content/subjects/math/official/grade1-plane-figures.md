# Plane Figures

Generate tasks that help students recognize and understand basic two-dimensional shapes: circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, and rectangles. Focus on identifying properties and finding shapes in the environment.

## Task Variations

### 1. Identifying Shapes by Name
Recognize basic 2D shapes:

What shape is this?

<svg width="120" height="80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="60" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
</svg>

Is this a **circle**, **triangle**, **rectangle**, or **quadrilateral**?

**Example:** Show a rectangle and ask students to identify it.

---

### 2. Counting Sides
Understand shape properties by counting:

How many **sides** does a {{shape}} have?

**Example:** How many sides does a triangle have? (Answer: 3)

---

### 3. Counting Corners (Vertices)
Understand shape properties by counting:

How many **corners** does a {{shape}} have?

**Example:** How many corners does a rectangle have? (Answer: 4)

---

### 4. Matching Shapes to Objects
Connect shapes with real-world objects:

Which object has the shape of a {{shape}}?

a) {{object1}}
b) {{object2}}
c) {{object3}}

**Example:** Which object has the shape of a circle?
a) a plate
b) a book
c) a roof

---

### 5. Drawing Shapes
Practice creating shapes:

**Draw** a {{shape}} in the space below.

Make sure your {{shape}} has:
- {{property1}}
- {{property2}}

**Example:** Draw a triangle. Make sure it has 3 sides and 3 corners.

---

### 6. Finding Shapes in Pictures
Identify shapes in complex images:

Look at this picture. Find and count all the **{{shape}}s**.

How many {{shape}}s can you find?

**Example:** Find all the rectangles in a picture of a house.

---

### 7. Sorting Shapes
Classify shapes by properties:

Sort these shapes into two groups:

**Has corners** and **No corners**

Shapes: circle, triangle, rectangle, {{additional_shape}}

---

### 8. Comparing Shapes
Compare properties of different shapes:

| Shape | Number of Sides | Number of Corners |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Triangle | ? | ? |
| Rectangle | ? | ? |
| Circle | ? | ? |

Fill in the table with the correct numbers.

---

### 9. True or False About Shapes
Test understanding of shape properties:

True or False: A rectangle has **{{num}}** corners.

**Example:** True or False: A rectangle has 5 corners. (Answer: False, it has 4)
