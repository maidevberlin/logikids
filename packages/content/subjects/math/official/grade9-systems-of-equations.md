name: Systems of Linear Equations (3 Variables)
description: Solving systems of three linear equations with three unknowns using substitution, elimination, and Gaussian elimination methods, including real-world modeling
grade: 9
focus: Three-variable linear systems and systematic solution methods
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Model real-world situations as systems of three linear equations with three unknowns
  - Apply substitution method systematically to reduce three-variable systems to two-variable systems
  - Use elimination method to eliminate variables and reduce system complexity
  - Apply Gaussian elimination with forward and back substitution to solve systems
  - Verify solutions by substituting into all three original equations
  - Determine solution existence and uniqueness through systematic reduction
  - Interpret three-variable solutions geometrically as the intersection of three planes
problem_types:
  - Substitution method
  - Elimination method
  - Gaussian elimination
  - Word problem modeling
  - Solution verification
  - System reduction steps
  - Geometric interpretation
  - Real-world applications
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - One equation already solved for a variable (z = ... form)
    - Integer coefficients between -5 and 5
    - Solutions are small integers between -5 and 5
  medium:
    - All equations in standard form requiring systematic elimination
    - Coefficients between -10 and 10, may include simple fractions
    - Solutions may be fractions with denominators up to 12
  hard:
    - Systems requiring multiple elimination steps and strategic variable choice
    - Word problems translating three constraints into equations
    - Coefficients requiring careful fraction or decimal arithmetic
prerequisites:
  - grade8-linear-systems
  - grade7-linear-equations
  - grade7-algebraic-terms
real_world_context:
  - Determining optimal mixture of three ingredients to meet nutritional requirements for protein, carbohydrates, and fat in a meal plan
  - Finding equilibrium prices in economics when three markets (goods, labor, money) interact with supply and demand constraints
  - Calculating traffic flow at intersections where three roads meet with known inflow and outflow rates at each junction
  - Solving chemistry mixture problems involving three substances with different concentrations to achieve target composition
  - Balancing production schedules in manufacturing when three products share limited resources (time, materials, workers)
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid systems with more than three equations or three unknowns
  - Don't introduce matrix notation, determinants, or Cramer's rule
  - Avoid coefficients requiring complex fraction arithmetic beyond basic operations
  - Don't present systems with no solution or infinite solutions at easy level
  - Avoid context requiring advanced knowledge beyond Grade 9 curriculum
