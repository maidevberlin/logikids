id: grade4-area-perimeter
name: Area and Perimeter
description: Calculating area and perimeter of rectangles and squares; using square units; distinguishing between area and perimeter; solving word problems with missing dimensions
grade: 4
focus: Area and perimeter measurement of rectangles and squares
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand perimeter as the total distance around the edge of a shape
  - Calculate the perimeter of rectangles and squares by adding all side lengths
  - Calculate the area of rectangles using length × width
  - Calculate the area of squares using side × side
  - Use appropriate square units (cm², m²) for area measurements
  - Distinguish between area (space inside) and perimeter (distance around)
  - Find missing side lengths when given area or perimeter
problem_types:
  - Perimeter calculation
  - Area calculation
  - Unit conversion
  - Missing dimension
  - Area vs perimeter
  - Word problems
  - Rectangle comparison
  - Square problems
  - Real-world application
  - Composite shapes
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple rectangles and squares with whole number dimensions (1-10)
    - Direct calculation of perimeter or area (not both together)
    - Clear labels indicating which measurement is needed
  medium:
    - Rectangles with dimensions up to 20
    - Problems requiring both area and perimeter calculations
    - Finding one missing dimension when given area or perimeter
  hard:
    - Comparing multiple shapes by area and perimeter
    - Finding dimensions with constraints (e.g., perimeter = 24, find possible rectangles)
    - Word problems requiring interpretation and multi-step reasoning
prerequisites:
  - grade3-area
  - grade4-numbers-to-million
real_world_context:
  - Calculating how much fencing is needed to go around a garden (perimeter)
  - Determining how many square tiles or carpet is needed to cover a floor (area)
  - Finding the border length needed for a picture frame (perimeter)
  - Comparing the size of different rooms or yards to see which has more space (area)
  - Planning how much paint or wallpaper is needed to cover a wall (area)
anti_patterns:
  - Don't confuse area and perimeter - specify which measurement is needed
  - Avoid irregular shapes - focus only on rectangles and squares
  - Don't use fractional dimensions - keep to whole numbers
  - Avoid mixing different units in the same problem without conversion context
  - Don't introduce formulas without context - connect to real measurements
