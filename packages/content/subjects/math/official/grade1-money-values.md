# Money Values Tasks

Create money recognition and simple counting tasks that help students learn about Euro and Cent coins and bills. Focus on visual recognition, counting small amounts, and understanding the relationship between different denominations.

**Vary the coin/bill types:**
- **Vary using single denomination:** Count how many 1-cent coins make 5 cents, or how many 2-euro coins are shown
- **Vary using two denominations:** Combine 1-cent and 2-cent coins, or 5-euro and 10-euro bills
- **Vary using visual arrays:** Show coins in pictures and ask students to count the total value
- **Vary using identification tasks:** "Which coin/bill is this?" with images of different denominations
- **Vary using comparison tasks:** "Which is worth more: a 50-cent coin or a 20-cent coin?"

**Vary the amounts:**
- For ages 6-7: Single coins (1¢, 2¢, 5¢, 10¢, 20¢, 50¢)
- For ages 6-7: Small bills (5€, 10€)
- Total amounts between 1¢ and 20€

**Vary the context:**
- Pocket money scenarios: "You get 5 one-euro coins as pocket money. How much do you have?"
- Shopping scenarios: "An apple costs 50 cents. Show which coins you need."
- Counting savings: "You have three 2-euro coins in your piggy bank. How much money is that?"
- Exchange problems: "Can you pay 10 cents with five 2-cent coins?"

**Vary the representation:**
- Show actual coin/bill images (use simple SVG circles/rectangles with denominations labeled)
- Use tables to organize different payment options
- Present money amounts in text: "5 Euro" or "20 Cent"

**Use clear visual representations with SVG for coins and bills when appropriate. Keep language simple and relate to everyday experiences of young children.**
