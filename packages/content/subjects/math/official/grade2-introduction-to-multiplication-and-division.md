name: Introduction to Multiplication and Division
description: Understanding multiplication as repeated addition and division as sharing and grouping, with times tables for 2, 5, and 10
grade: 2
ages:
  - 7
  - 8
focus: Numbers and operations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand multiplication as repeated addition and array representations
  - Recognize division as both sharing (partitive) and grouping (quotitive)
  - Learn multiplication facts for 2, 5, and 10
  - Understand the commutative property of multiplication
  - Recognize the inverse relationship between multiplication and division
  - Solve simple word problems involving multiplication and division
prerequisites:
  - grade2-addition-and-subtraction-up-to-100
real_world_context: Counting legs on animals, arranging items in equal groups, skip counting, sharing snacks fairly, dividing toys equally, buying multiple identical items
problem_types:
  - Repeated addition
  - Sharing division
  - Grouping division
  - Array models
  - Times tables 2/5/10
  - Inverse relationships
  - Commutative property
  - Word problems
  - Missing factors
  - Operation comparison
age_guidelines:
  7:
    - Focus on concrete, visual representations with simple contexts
    - Use smaller numbers within 2 and 5 times tables
    - Emphasize hands-on thinking with counting objects, drawing groups, arrays
    - Present one-step problems with clear, simple language
    - Limit to basic multiplication facts and simple division without remainders
    - Use familiar everyday contexts like cookies, toys, fingers, legs
  8:
    - Introduce more abstract thinking with less visual support
    - Expand to 10 times table and larger products within range
    - Include two-step reasoning requiring operation identification then calculation
    - Present problems requiring strategy selection or explanation
    - Introduce simple remainders in division contexts
    - Use varied contexts including money, measurement, multi-step scenarios
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct calculation of basic facts within practiced times tables
    - Clear visual or concrete representations provided
    - One-step word problems with obvious operation choice
    - Numbers producing whole number quotients with no remainder
    - Skip counting with predictable patterns
  medium:
    - Mixed problems requiring operation identification
    - Word problems without explicit visual aids
    - Fact families connecting multiplication and division
    - Simple missing number problems
    - Comparing different strategies or approaches
    - Introduction to remainders with concrete sharing contexts
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining both operations
    - Complex word problems requiring interpretation and setup
    - Missing numbers in various positions within equations
    - Justification of commutative property or inverse relationships
    - Non-routine problems requiring strategic thinking
    - Division with remainders requiring interpretation
