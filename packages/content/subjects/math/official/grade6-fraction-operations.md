name: Fraction Operations
description: Comprehensive fraction work including expanding, reducing, converting, and performing all four operations with fractions
grade: 6
ages:
  - 11
  - 12
focus: Numbers and Operations - Fraction Arithmetic
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Expand and reduce fractions to equivalent forms using greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple
  - Convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages with understanding
  - Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators using common denominators
  - Multiply and divide fractions, understanding the conceptual basis for algorithms
  - Solve multi-step word problems involving all fraction operations in real-world contexts
  - Compare and order fractions using multiple strategies including cross-multiplication and common denominators
  - Apply fraction operations to solve problems involving measurements, money, and ratios
prerequisites:
  - grade4-fractions
real_world_context: Fraction operations are essential for cooking and baking (scaling recipes by factors like 1½ times), construction and carpentry (cutting materials into fractional lengths), tailoring (calculating fabric amounts), shopping and discounts (half-price, 2/3 off), time management (working for 2½ hours), and financial literacy (calculating tips, understanding discounts, managing portions). Grade 6 students encounter fractions when working with recipes, understanding sports statistics, calculating areas of rooms, and solving problems involving fair division of quantities. Mastery of fraction operations forms the foundation for algebra, ratios, proportions, and later mathematics including working with rational numbers.
problem_types:
  - fraction simplification
  - common denominators
  - fraction addition
  - fraction subtraction
  - fraction multiplication
  - fraction division
  - mixed operations
  - fraction comparison
  - word problems
  - representation conversion
age_guidelines:
  11:
    - Begin with visual fraction models alongside symbolic notation
    - Use denominators that are related before requiring LCD calculation
    - Keep numerators and denominators relatively small (denominators typically ≤ 12)
    - Use mixed numbers sparingly; emphasize proper and improper fractions first
    - Provide more explicit step-by-step problem structure
    - Emphasize the "why" behind procedures
    - Use familiar, relatable real-world contexts
    - Include visual representations in majority of tasks
    - Focus on understanding operations before combining them
  12:
    - Reduce reliance on visual representations, increasing symbolic manipulation
    - Work with all common denominators independently
    - Include larger numerators and denominators (up to 20)
    - Use mixed numbers and improper fractions regularly
    - Present more abstract mathematical contexts alongside real-world applications
    - Increase complexity of multi-step problems and mixed operations
    - Include problems where simplification strategies matter for efficiency
    - Use word problems with less explicit structure
    - Challenge with problems requiring multiple solution strategies
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-step operations on proper fractions with straightforward denominators
    - Addition and subtraction where one denominator is a multiple of the other
    - Multiplication by whole numbers or simple unit fractions
    - Division by whole numbers
    - Fractions already in lowest terms or requiring only obvious simplification
    - Word problems with direct, clear operation selection
    - Visual representations provided for all operations
  medium:
    - Two-step operations combining addition/subtraction or other pairs
    - Finding LCD when denominators share no obvious relationship
    - Multiplication of any fractions including mixed numbers with strategic simplification
    - Division of fractions with thoughtful remainder interpretation
    - Simplification requiring GCD understanding
    - Comparison of fractions with unlike denominators using multiple strategies
    - Word problems requiring interpretation and operation selection
    - Mix of symbolic and visual representations
    - Problems combining operations with order of operations awareness
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining three or more operations
    - Complex word problems requiring multiple steps and careful interpretation
    - Problems where efficiency of approach matters
    - Division and multiplication of mixed numbers in context
    - Comparing strategies for different solution approaches
    - Problems requiring conversion between representations
    - Abstract reasoning about fraction properties and relationships
    - Minimal or no visual support; emphasis on symbolic understanding
    - Inverse operation problems requiring algebraic thinking
