name: Patterns and Simple Equations
description: Recognizing and extending number patterns, finding sequence rules, understanding variables as placeholders, solving simple one-step equations, and describing mathematical relationships
grade: 4
focus: Algebraic thinking and pattern recognition
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and extend number patterns with consistent rules (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
  - Identify the rule governing a sequence or pattern and express it in words
  - Understand variables as placeholders for unknown values in equations
  - Solve simple one-step equations using inverse operations (e.g., □ + 5 = 12)
  - Complete input-output tables by applying function rules
  - Apply order of operations with parentheses in simple expressions
  - Describe mathematical relationships using both words and symbols
problem_types:
  - Pattern extension
  - Rule identification
  - Missing term
  - One-step equation
  - Input-output table
  - Function machine
  - Order of operations
  - Variable substitution
  - Inverse operation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple addition or subtraction patterns (add 3, subtract 5)
    - Equations with addition or subtraction only, numbers under 50
    - Input-output tables with single-operation rules
  medium:
    - Multiplication or division patterns (multiply by 2, divide by 3)
    - Mixed operations in equations, numbers up to 100
    - Two-step patterns or tables requiring multiple operations
  hard:
    - Complex patterns with alternating or multiple rules
    - Equations requiring multiple inverse operations or parentheses
    - Tables with two-variable relationships or non-obvious patterns
prerequisites:
  - grade3-arithmetic-laws
  - grade3-multiplication-tables
real_world_context:
  - Growing plant heights measured each week following a pattern
  - Money saved each month to reach a savings goal
  - Building block towers where each level follows a construction rule
  - Price calculations in a shop with consistent pricing patterns
  - Game scores that increase by fixed amounts each round
  - Stacking chairs where each row adds a fixed number
  - Tracking daily step count patterns over a week
  - A DJ mixing music with beats following mathematical patterns
  - Counting seats in theater rows that increase by a fixed number
  - Predicting next numbers in sports jersey numbering systems
  - Tracking book pages read following a daily reading plan
  - Following knitting or crocheting patterns with repeating sequences
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid patterns requiring numbers above 1000 or decimal operations
  - Don't use algebraic notation beyond simple placeholder symbols (□, ?, x)
  - Avoid multi-step equations requiring more than two operations
  - Don't combine order of operations with complex nested parentheses
  - Avoid patterns requiring advanced concepts like exponents or square roots
