id: grade5-fractions-operations
name: Operations with Fractions
description: Adding and subtracting fractions with same and different denominators, multiplying fractions by whole numbers, and simplifying fractions to lowest terms
grade: 5
focus: Fraction operations and computational fluency
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Add fractions with same denominators and simplify results
  - Subtract fractions with same denominators and simplify results
  - Find common denominators for unlike fractions using multiples
  - Add and subtract fractions with different denominators
  - Multiply fractions by whole numbers and interpret results
  - Simplify fractions to lowest terms using common factors
problem_types:
  - Same-denominator addition
  - Same-denominator subtraction
  - Finding common denominators
  - Unlike-denominator addition
  - Unlike-denominator subtraction
  - Fraction-whole multiplication
  - Simplification practice
  - Multi-step word problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Same denominators up to 12, no simplification required
    - Common denominators that are simple multiples (e.g., 4 and 8)
    - Whole number multiplication with unit fractions or simple fractions
  medium:
    - Different denominators requiring common denominators up to 24
    - Results requiring simplification to lowest terms
    - Two-step problems combining operations
  hard:
    - Complex denominators requiring calculation of least common multiple
    - Multi-step problems requiring multiple operations and simplification
    - Word problems requiring interpretation and operation selection
prerequisites:
  - grade4-fractions
  - grade3-multiplication-division-strategies
real_world_context:
  - Combining recipe ingredients with different measurements (1/2 cup + 1/4 cup)
  - Sharing and dividing food portions among friends or family members
  - Measuring fabric, wood, or craft materials for projects
  - Calculating time fractions (1/2 hour + 3/4 hour of study time)
  - Determining portions in sports or games (combining playing times)
  - A pizza party where friends combine leftover slices from different pizzas
  - Mixing paint colors using fractional amounts of each color
  - Calculating remaining fuel in a tank after using fractional portions
  - A runner tracking fractional miles completed during training
  - Combining partial rolls of wrapping paper for a gift
  - Measuring ingredients for a chemistry experiment in fractions
  - A musician practicing different song sections for fractional hours
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid division of fractions (separate advanced concept)
  - Don't use improper fractions or mixed numbers extensively in problems
  - Avoid denominators larger than 24
  - Don't combine fraction operations with decimal operations in same problem
  - Avoid contexts requiring prior knowledge of specialized domains
