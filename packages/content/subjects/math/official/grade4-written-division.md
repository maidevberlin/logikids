# Written Division - Problem Variations

Generate tasks that develop mastery of written division with single-digit divisors, including remainders and verification.

## Variation 1: Three-Digit Division (No Remainder)
Calculate using written division:

$${{dividend}} : {{divisor}} = \, ?$$

Check your answer by multiplication.

**Example:** $846 : 6 = 141$
Check: $141 \times 6 = 846$ ✓

**Calculation steps:**
```

## Variation 2: Three-Digit Division (With Remainder)
Solve using written division and give the remainder:

$${{dividend}} : {{divisor}} = \, ? \text{ Rest } ?$$

**Example:** $457 : 3 = 152$ Rest $1$
Check: $152 \times 3 + 1 = 456 + 1 = 457$ ✓

## Variation 3: Four-Digit Division
Calculate:

$${{dividend}} : {{divisor}} = \, ?$$

Write out all steps of the written division method.

**Example:** $1250 : 8 = 156$ Rest $2$

**Steps:**
```

```

## Variation 4: Word Problem - Equal Sharing
A bakery produces ${{total_items}}$ cookies. They want to pack them into boxes with ${{per_box}}$ cookies each. How many full boxes can they make? How many cookies are left over?

**Example:** 845 cookies, 7 per box → $845 : 7 = 120$ Rest $5$ → 120 full boxes, 5 cookies left

## Variation 5: Word Problem - Cost Calculation
A school ordered ${{num_items}}$ books for a total of €${{total_cost}}$. How much does one book cost?

**Example:** 6 books for €846 → $846 : 6 = 141$ → One book costs €141

## Variation 6: Division with Zero in Quotient
Solve using written division:

$${{dividend}} : {{divisor}} = \, ?$$

**Example:** $3045 : 5 = 609$

**Important:** Watch for zeros in the middle of the quotient!
```

## Variation 7: Multi-Step Division Problem
A farmer harvested ${{total_kg}}$ kg of apples. He fills crates with ${{kg_per_crate}}$ kg each.
a) How many full crates does he get?
b) How many kg are in the incomplete crate?
c) If each full crate sells for €${{price}}$, how much money does he earn from the full crates?

**Example:** 1256 kg total, 8 kg per crate, €12 per crate
a) $1256 : 8 = 157$ full crates
b) Remainder: $0$ kg
c) $157 \times 12 = 1884$ euros

## Variation 8: Division Check with Estimation
Before calculating exactly, estimate the result by rounding:

$${{dividend}} : {{divisor}} \approx \, ?$$

Then calculate the exact answer and check if your estimation was reasonable.

**Example:** $2847 : 7$
Estimation: $2800 : 7 = 400$ (rounded)
Exact: $2847 : 7 = 406$ Rest $5$
Check: $406 \times 7 + 5 = 2842 + 5 = 2847$ ✓
