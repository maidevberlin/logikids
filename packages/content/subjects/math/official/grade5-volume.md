id: grade5-volume
name: Volume of Cuboids and Cubes
description: Calculate volume using formulas, convert between cubic units, and relate volume to capacity
grade: 5
focus: Measurement and geometric calculation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand volume as space occupied by 3D objects
  - Calculate volume of cubes using edge cubed
  - Calculate volume of cuboids using length times width times height
  - Convert between cubic units (cm³, dm³, m³)
  - Relate cubic decimeters to liters
  - Solve volume problems with missing dimensions
problem_types:
  - Cube volume calculation
  - Cuboid volume calculation
  - Cubic unit conversion
  - Volume comparison
  - Missing dimension problems
  - Capacity relationships
  - Multi-step volume problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Cubes and simple cuboids with whole number dimensions under 10
    - Direct application of volume formulas
    - Single-step calculations with all dimensions provided
  medium:
    - Cuboids with larger dimensions up to 50
    - Simple unit conversions between adjacent cubic units
    - One missing dimension requiring calculation
  hard:
    - Missing dimensions requiring multi-step reasoning
    - Complex unit conversions involving liters and cubic decimeters
    - Comparison problems requiring calculation of multiple volumes
real_world_context:
  - Calculating water capacity for aquariums and fish tanks
  - Determining space in shipping boxes and containers
  - Finding volume of swimming pools and water needed to fill them
  - Planning storage space and packing efficiency
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid non-rectangular prisms like cylinders or pyramids
  - Don't use irregular or composite 3D solids
  - Avoid cubic units larger than cubic meters
  - Don't combine volume with surface area in same problem
  - Avoid decimal dimensions beyond one decimal place
prerequisites:
  - grade4-volume-unit-cubes
  - grade4-measurement-units
  - grade5-units-measurement
