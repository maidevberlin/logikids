difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Cubes and simple cuboids with whole number dimensions under 10
    - Direct application of volume formulas
    - Single-step calculations with all dimensions provided
  medium:
    - Cuboids with larger dimensions up to 50
    - Simple unit conversions between adjacent cubic units
    - One missing dimension requiring calculation
  hard:
    - Missing dimensions requiring multi-step reasoning
    - Complex unit conversions involving liters and cubic decimeters
    - Comparison problems requiring calculation of multiple volumes
real_world_context:
