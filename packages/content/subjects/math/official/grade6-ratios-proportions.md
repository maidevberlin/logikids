name: Ratios and Proportions
description: Understanding and working with ratios, proportional relationships, and solving proportions using cross multiplication
grade: 6
ages:
  - 11
  - 12
focus: Numbers and Operations - Ratios, Proportions, and Proportional Relationships
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Express ratios in multiple forms (part-to-part, part-to-whole) and simplify ratios to lowest terms using greatest common divisor
  - Recognize and identify proportional relationships between quantities, determining whether two ratios are equivalent
  - Solve proportions using cross multiplication method and other strategies (scaling, unit rates)
  - Apply proportional reasoning to real-world problems including recipes, maps, scale drawings, rates, and comparisons
  - Recognize proportional vs. non-proportional relationships in tables, graphs, and contexts
  - Work with unit rates and use them to compare quantities and solve problems
  - Apply ratio and proportion concepts to scaling quantities, enlargements, reductions, and similarity
prerequisites:
  - fraction-operations
  - divisibility-prime-numbers
real_world_context: Ratios and proportions permeate everyday life - recipes require scaling ingredients (if 2 cups flour makes 12 cookies, how much flour for 18 cookies?), maps use scale ratios (1 cm represents 10 km), cooking requires understanding ingredient ratios and adjusting portions, shopping involves comparing unit prices and rates, photography and art use aspect ratios and proportional enlargement, sports statistics rely on ratios (points per game, batting averages), medicine uses dose ratios based on weight, construction uses proportional scaling in blueprints, and financial literacy involves rates of return and proportional calculations. Grade 6 students encounter proportional reasoning when resizing images, understanding scale models, calculating travel distances using maps, comparing recipe ingredients, determining fair trades in games or exchanges, and solving problems requiring equivalent reasoning. Mastery of proportions forms the foundation for algebra (linear relationships), geometry (similarity and scale), and practical problem-solving across all domains.

age_guidelines:
  11:
    - Focus on simple whole number ratios (2:3, 1:4, 3:5, not more complex like 7:11)
    - Use familiar contexts (recipes, sports teams, simple comparisons)
    - Emphasize simplification using obvious common factors (2, 3, 5, 10)
    - Keep scale factors simple and often integers (2x, 3x, 1.5x)
    - Include visual representations (ratio diagrams, double number lines, tape diagrams)
    - Provide structured ratio table formats with clear headings
    - Ask explicit questions with clear operation selection
    - Keep map scales simple (1 inch = 1 mile rather than complex ratios)
    - Focus on direct proportional relationships; avoid inverse proportions initially
  12:
    - Work with more complex ratios including less obvious common factors
    - Include three-part ratios (3:2:1)
    - Use scale factors as decimals and fractions (0.5x, 2.5x, ⅔x)
    - Reduce scaffolding; expect independent proportion setup
    - Include more abstract mathematical contexts
    - Work with map scales involving larger numbers and unit conversions
    - Include both direct and inverse proportional relationships
    - Present problems with less explicit structure, requiring interpretation
    - Include comparisons requiring calculation and decision-making
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple whole number ratios with obvious simplification (4:2, 6:9, 8:4)
    - Proportions with simple cross multiplication (2/3 = ?/12)
    - Unit rate calculations with simple numbers (6 items for $12 → $2 per item)
    - Scale factors that are simple integers (multiply by 2 or 3)
    - Familiar contexts with clear operation identification
    - Ratio tables with obvious patterns
    - Visual support provided for all problems
    - Direct proportional relationships only
  medium:
    - Ratios requiring GCD calculation (15:25, 21:14, requiring factor finding)
    - Proportions with less obvious relationships
    - Three-part ratios with at least one calculation step
    - Unit rates requiring more calculation (5 items for $12.50)
    - Scale factors including simple decimals (1.5x, 2.5x)
    - Real-world problems with moderate complexity
    - Mixed direct and inverse proportional relationships
    - Comparison problems requiring ratios/unit rates
  hard:
    - Complex ratios with larger numbers and non-obvious factors (48:36, 56:42)
    - Multiple-step proportion problems
    - Three-part ratios with complex relationships
    - Scale factors as fractions (⅔x, ⅞x)
    - Abstract proportional reasoning problems
    - Proportional problems requiring interpretation and multi-step solution
    - Both direct and inverse proportions in context
    - Proportional reasoning applied to percentages and more abstract contexts
    - Inverse proportional problems (if one increases, the other decreases proportionally)
