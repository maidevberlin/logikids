name: Geometry and Spatial Awareness
description: Recognizing shapes, understanding spatial relations, and exploring symmetry through hands-on activities
grade: 1
ages:
  - 6
  - 7
focus: Space and Shape (Raum und Form)
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and name common three-dimensional shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, pyramid)
  - Identify and describe two-dimensional figures (circle, triangle, square, rectangle)
  - Use spatial vocabulary to describe positions and relations (above, below, left, right, in front of, behind)
  - Explore and recognize mirror symmetry in simple patterns and objects
  - Find geometric shapes in everyday environment
problem_types:
  - Shape recognition
  - Shape sorting by properties
  - Spatial position description
  - Shape component counting
  - Symmetry detection
  - Environmental shape hunt
  - Shape comparison
  - Position following
  - Pattern completion
  - Shape property matching
age_guidelines:
  6:
    - Focus on basic shapes (circle, square, triangle, cube, sphere)
    - Simple spatial terms (above, below, next to)
    - Clear, unambiguous visual examples
    - Familiar objects (toys, food, classroom items)
    - Direct questions with minimal multi-step reasoning
  7:
    - Include more complex shapes (rectangle, pentagon, cone, pyramid, cylinder)
    - Combined spatial relationships (above and to the left of)
    - Shapes in varied orientations or sizes
    - More abstract scenarios requiring visualization
    - Simple two-step reasoning (find shape, then count corners)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single shape identification from clear images
    - Basic spatial terms with obvious positions
    - Symmetry in simple familiar objects (butterfly, face)
    - One attribute comparison at a time
  medium:
    - Multiple shapes to identify or compare
    - Combined spatial relationships (between, corner)
    - Symmetry in patterns or arrangements
    - Two attributes to consider simultaneously
  hard:
    - Shapes in complex arrangements or unusual orientations
    - Precise spatial descriptions requiring multiple terms
    - Incomplete or partially hidden symmetry patterns
    - Three or more attributes to analyze
prerequisites: []
real_world_context: |
  First-graders encounter geometric shapes and spatial relationships constantly - building blocks, household objects, street signs, nature patterns, and playground equipment. Understanding shapes and spatial concepts helps children navigate their environment, describe locations, follow directions, and develop foundational skills for later geometric reasoning.
