# Representing and Interpreting Data

Create tasks where {{child_name}} creates and interprets various data representations while critically analyzing how data can be presented or manipulated appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Creating Pie Charts**: Convert frequency or percentage data to pie chart. "{{24}} students were surveyed: {{12}} prefer soccer, {{8}} basketball, {{4}} tennis. Create a pie chart." Emphasize that fractions of circle match fractions of total: soccer = $\frac{12}{24} = \frac{1}{2}$ of circle. Use data where fractions are simple ($\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{8}$, $\frac{1}{3}$).

2. **Reading Pie Charts**: Interpret existing pie charts. "This pie chart shows favorite subjects. Math is ${{25}}\\%$. If {{40}} students were surveyed, how many chose Math?" Or: "Which subject is most popular?" Include finding actual numbers from percentages and vice versa.

3. **Line Graphs for Change Over Time**: Create or read line graphs. "Plot temperature data: Mon {{15}}°C, Tue {{18}}°C, Wed {{16}}°C, Thu {{20}}°C, Fri {{17}}°C." Ask: "On which day was temperature highest?" "Between which days did temperature drop?" Vary context: plant growth, savings over months, test scores.

4. **Interpreting Line Graphs**: Analyze trends and patterns. "This graph shows a plant's height over {{6}} weeks. During which period did it grow fastest?" or "Describe the trend in book sales over the year." Include identifying increasing/decreasing trends, steepest slopes, flat periods.

5. **Misleading Graphs - Y-axis Manipulation**: Compare graphs with different y-axis scales. Show two bar graphs of same data: one with y-axis {{0-100}}, another {{50-100}}. "Why does the second graph make differences look bigger?" Discuss how starting y-axis above zero exaggerates differences.

6. **Misleading Graphs - Visual Distortion**: Identify misleading pictographs or 3D charts. "This pictograph uses images of different sizes. Why is this misleading?" Or show 3D bar chart where perspective distorts comparisons. Emphasize importance of consistent scale and simple 2D representations.

7. **Choosing Appropriate Representations**: Decide which graph type best shows data. "You want to show how temperature changes hour by hour. Which is best: {{pie chart, bar chart, or line graph}}?" (Line graph). Or: "To show parts of a whole budget, use: {{line graph or pie chart}}?" (Pie chart). Justify choices.

8. **Critical Analysis of Statistics**: Evaluate claims based on data. "A graph shows {{2}} more people prefer Brand A than Brand B. The graph makes it look like twice as many. Why?" or "Survey says '{{75}}\\% of dentists recommend our toothpaste.' What questions should you ask about this claim?" (Sample size? How many dentists surveyed? What were the other options?)

Use clear examples of different graph types. For pie charts, show how to calculate sector angles: $\text{angle} = \frac{\text{frequency}}{\text{total}} \times 360°$. For line graphs, use time on x-axis and measurement on y-axis with clear labels.

Present comparison tables:

| Graph Type | Best For | Example Use |
|---|---|---|
| Pie Chart | Parts of a whole | Budget breakdown |
| Bar Chart | Comparing categories | Favorite colors |
| Line Graph | Change over time | Temperature trend |

Emphasize critical thinking: "Does this graph fairly represent the data?" "What might be misleading about this representation?" "What additional information would help interpret this data?" Include discussions about:
- Appropriate y-axis range (starting at 0 vs. other values)
- Consistent intervals and scales
- Clear labels and titles
- Sample size and source of data
- Context and what's not shown

Connect to real applications: news media, advertising, scientific reports, political campaigns. Help students become critical consumers of statistical information.
