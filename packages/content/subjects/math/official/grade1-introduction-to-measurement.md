name: Introduction to Measurement
description: Comparing lengths, using non-standard units, and understanding basic time concepts
grade: 1
focus: Measurement fundamentals
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Compare objects by length using terms longer, shorter, and same length
  - Order three or more objects by length from shortest to longest
  - Measure length using non-standard units like paper clips or hand spans
  - Read time to the hour on analog and digital clocks
  - Identify and sequence days of the week in correct order
  - Understand the concept of yesterday, today, and tomorrow
  - Recognize that weeks consist of seven days
problem_types:
  - Length comparison
  - Length ordering
  - Non-standard measurement
  - Clock reading
  - Day sequencing
  - Time vocabulary
  - Week understanding
  - Duration comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Compare two objects with clear visual differences
    - Read whole hours on clock faces (1:00, 3:00, etc.)
    - Identify consecutive days of the week
  medium:
    - Order 3-4 objects by length
    - Measure objects using 3-8 non-standard units
    - Determine next/previous day given a day of the week
  hard:
    - Order 5+ objects or solve multi-step length problems
    - Use non-standard units to compare two measurements
    - Calculate how many days between events in same week
real_world_context:
  - Comparing heights of family members, friends, or classroom objects
  - Using hand spans or footsteps to measure classroom furniture or playground equipment
  - Reading clocks to know when activities happen during the school day
  - Using calendars to track days of the week for school schedules and weekend plans
  - Understanding time words like morning, afternoon, and evening in daily routines
  - A giant measuring objects using his massive footsteps as units
  - Comparing the lengths of different toy cars or trains
  - Figuring out which pencil, crayon, or marker is longest
  - Knowing what time favorite TV shows or bedtime stories start
  - Planning activities for different days of the week at summer camp
  - A caterpillar measuring leaves by crawling along their length
  - Comparing ribbons to see which is long enough for a gift
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using standard units like centimeters or meters
  - Don't include half-hours or minutes on clock faces
  - Avoid complex word problems requiring calculations beyond simple comparison
  - Don't combine measurement types in a single problem
  - Avoid unfamiliar time contexts beyond daily school/home routines
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
