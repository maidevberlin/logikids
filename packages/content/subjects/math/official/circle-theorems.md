# Thales' Theorem and Circle Theorems Tasks

Create mathematics problems that explore angle relationships in circles. Problems should help students apply Thales' theorem, understand the relationship between central and inscribed angles, and work with tangent properties.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Thales' theorem application**: Triangle inscribed in semicircle with diameter as one side has a right angle opposite to the diameter
- **Inscribed angle theorem**: Inscribed angle is half the central angle subtending the same arc, i.e., inscribed angle = $\frac{1}{2}$ × central angle
- **Central angle and arc**: Central angle equals the arc it subtends (in degrees), calculate angle given arc or vice versa
- **Inscribed angles on same arc**: All inscribed angles subtending the same arc are equal
- **Angle in semicircle**: Any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle (90°)
- **Cyclic quadrilateral**: Opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral (inscribed in circle) sum to 180°
- **Tangent-radius**: Tangent to circle is perpendicular to radius at point of tangency (forms 90° angle)
- **Tangent from external point**: Two tangents from external point to circle are equal in length
- **Tangent-chord angle**: Angle between tangent and chord equals inscribed angle in alternate segment
- **Angles in alternate segments**: Angle between chord and tangent equals inscribed angle in opposite segment

**Vary the content/context:**
- **Architecture**: Arches in bridges and buildings, dome designs, circular windows, rose windows in cathedrals
- **Engineering**: Wheel and gear design, circular mechanisms, cam profiles
- **Astronomy**: Planetary orbits, angular measurement of celestial objects, satellite dishes
- **Design**: Circular logos, mandala patterns, circular art installations
- **Sports**: Circular tracks, discus circles, center circles in sports fields
- **Navigation**: Compass angles, circular navigation patterns, lighthouse visibility

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 14): Focus on Thales' theorem and basic inscribed angle theorem, clear diagrams with one or two angles to find, direct application of theorems, whole number angles
- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 14-15): Multiple angle calculations in one problem, cyclic quadrilaterals, tangent properties, combine multiple theorems, work with algebraic expressions for angles (e.g., 2x, 3x)
- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 16): Complex problems requiring multiple theorem applications, prove angle relationships, alternate segment theorem, combined with other geometry (similar triangles, coordinate geometry), optimization problems

**Use appropriate formats:**

**LaTeX for formulas:**
- Inline for theorems: Inscribed angle $= \frac{1}{2} \times$ central angle, opposite angles in cyclic quadrilateral: $\alpha + \gamma = 180°$
- Block for key relationships:

$$\text{Inscribed angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Central angle}$$

$$\angle A + \angle C = 180° \text{ (Cyclic quadrilateral)}$$

**Tables for angle relationships:**

| Central Angle | Inscribed Angle | Arc |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| 80° | 40° | 80° |
| 120° | 60° | 120° |
| 180° | 90° | 180° (semicircle) |

**SVG diagrams for circle theorems:**

Use SVG to show:
- Circles with inscribed triangles and angles marked
- Central angles and inscribed angles subtending same arc
- Semicircles with inscribed triangles (Thales' theorem)
- Cyclic quadrilaterals with opposite angles marked
- Tangent lines with perpendicular radius marked
- Two tangents from external point
- Chord-tangent angle with alternate segment angle

**Adjust difficulty with {{difficulty}}:**
- **Easy**: Single theorem application (Thales or inscribed angle), clear diagram, one or two angles to calculate, direct use of theorem with no algebraic manipulation
- **Medium**: Combine two theorems, cyclic quadrilaterals, tangent properties, 3-4 angles to find using multiple steps, simple algebraic angles (x, 2x)
- **Hard**: Multi-step problems requiring 3+ theorem applications, prove angle relationships, alternate segment theorem, complex algebraic expressions (2x+10°, 3x-20°), combined with trigonometry or coordinate geometry

**Include variety in numerical values:**
- Central angles: 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°
- Inscribed angles: 30°, 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°
- Arcs: 90°, 110°, 135°, 150°, 200°
- Angles in cyclic quadrilaterals: pairs summing to 180° (70° and 110°, 85° and 95°)
- Tangent-chord angles: 35°, 42°, 58°, 65°
- Algebraic expressions: x, 2x, 3x, x+20°, 2x-15°
- Ensure variety in which angles are given and which need to be calculated
- Use angles that create interesting relationships and require multi-step reasoning
