name: Number Concept Development
description: Understanding numbers 1-20, counting forwards and backwards, comparing and ordering numbers
grade: 1
ages:
  - 6
  - 7
focus: Number sense and early arithmetic
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Count objects systematically up to 20
  - Recognize, read, and write numbers 1-20
  - Compare and order numbers using <, >, = symbols
  - Understand place value in the tens structure
  - Count forwards and backwards within 20
  - Identify even and odd numbers
prerequisites: []
real_world_context: Counting objects in daily life, understanding quantities in shopping, games, and classroom activities
problem_types:
  - Counting collections
  - Number recognition
  - Number writing
  - Comparing quantities
  - Ordering numbers
  - Number before/after/between
  - Even/odd recognition
  - Place value introduction
  - Counting forwards/backwards
  - Number composition
age_guidelines:
  6:
    - Focus on numbers 1-10 initially, gradually extending to 20
    - Use highly visual, concrete representations with familiar objects
    - Emphasize counting one-by-one with finger pointing
    - Use simple comparison language (more, less, same) before symbols
    - Provide clear, structured arrangements that support counting
    - Focus on recognition before production (identifying before writing)
  7:
    - Work confidently across the full 1-20 range
    - Include more abstract representations alongside concrete visuals
    - Expect faster counting strategies (counting in groups, skip counting by 2s)
    - Use comparison symbols (<, >, =) more consistently
    - Include scattered or unorganized arrangements requiring systematic counting
    - Combine multiple concepts (ordering AND comparing, counting AND writing)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Numbers primarily in range 1-10
    - Highly structured visual arrangements (rows, ten-frames)
    - Single-step tasks with clear visual support
    - Direct questions with one correct answer
    - Familiar, everyday objects and contexts
  medium:
    - Full range 1-20 with emphasis on teen numbers
    - Mix of structured and less organized arrangements
    - Two-step tasks (count and then compare, or order and identify missing)
    - Beginning use of mathematical symbols and notation
    - Variety of visual representations requiring flexibility
  hard:
    - Challenging numbers 15-20 with complex teen number structures
    - Abstract representations with minimal visual scaffolding
    - Multi-step problems combining several concepts
    - Finding errors in counting sequences or number comparisons
    - Explaining reasoning about even/odd or place value relationships
version: 1
version_notes: Migrated from prose-based format to frontmatter-based format with structured problem types, age guidelines, and difficulty guidelines
