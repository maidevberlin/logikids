# Number Concept Development (Ages 6-7)

Generate tasks that help first graders develop fundamental number sense for numbers 1-20. Focus on concrete, visual, and playful approaches appropriate for young learners who are just beginning their mathematical journey.

## Problem Type Variations

Create diverse task structures to build comprehensive number understanding:

1. **Counting Collections**: Present visual arrangements of objects (dots, animals, toys, fruits) and ask students to count systematically. Vary arrangements from structured (rows, groups of 5 or 10) to scattered patterns.

2. **Number Recognition**: Show numerals and ask students to identify them, or show quantities and ask which numeral matches. Include both direction: numeral to quantity and quantity to numeral.

3. **Number Writing**: Provide visual or verbal prompts for students to write the correct numeral. Describe practice with tracing and independent writing.

4. **Comparing Quantities**: Present two or three groups of objects or numbers and ask which is larger, smaller, or if they are equal. Use comparison symbols appropriately for age.

5. **Ordering Numbers**: Give a set of numbers (3-5 numbers) in random order and ask students to arrange them from smallest to largest or vice versa. Include finding missing numbers in sequences.

6. **Number Before/After/Between**: Provide a number and ask what comes before, after, or between two given numbers. Build sequential understanding.

7. **Even and Odd Recognition**: Present numbers or quantities and ask students to identify whether they are even or odd. Use visual grouping strategies (pairs of objects).

8. **Place Value Introduction**: Show numbers 11-20 and ask students to identify how many tens and ones. Use ten-frames or bundled sticks as visual models.

9. **Counting Forwards and Backwards**: Start from various positions (not always 1 or 20) and ask students to continue counting in either direction for several steps.

10. **Number Composition**: Show a quantity and ask students to represent it in different ways (e.g., showing how many tens and ones make the number).

## Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

Adjust cognitive demands based on student development:

**For younger first graders ({{age}} = 6):**
- Focus on numbers 1-10 initially, gradually extending to 20
- Use highly visual, concrete representations with familiar objects
- Emphasize counting one-by-one with finger pointing
- Use simple comparison language (more, less, same) before symbols
- Provide clear, structured arrangements that support counting
- Focus on recognition before production (identifying before writing)

**For older first graders ({{age}} = 7):**
- Work confidently across the full 1-20 range
- Include more abstract representations alongside concrete visuals
- Expect faster counting strategies (counting in groups, skip counting by 2s)
- Use comparison symbols (<, >, =) more consistently
- Include scattered or unorganized arrangements requiring systematic counting
- Combine multiple concepts (ordering AND comparing, counting AND writing)

## Difficulty Scaling

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy):**
- Numbers primarily in range 1-10
- Highly structured visual arrangements (rows, ten-frames)
- Single-step tasks with clear visual support
- Direct questions with one correct answer
- Familiar, everyday objects and contexts

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium):**
- Full range 1-20 with emphasis on teen numbers
- Mix of structured and less organized arrangements
- Two-step tasks (count and then compare, or order and identify missing)
- Beginning use of mathematical symbols and notation
- Variety of visual representations requiring flexibility

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard):**
- Challenging numbers 15-20 with complex teen number structures
- Abstract representations with minimal visual scaffolding
- Multi-step problems combining several concepts
- Finding errors in counting sequences or number comparisons
- Explaining reasoning about even/odd or place value relationships

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Generate diverse number ranges to build flexible understanding:

- **For counting tasks**: Vary quantities from very small (2-3) to full range (18-20), ensuring practice across entire spectrum
- **For comparing tasks**: Use number pairs with varying differences (adjacent numbers like 7 and 8, numbers with medium gaps like 5 and 12, numbers with large gaps like 3 and 19)
- **For ordering tasks**: Mix consecutive sequences, sequences with gaps, and random unordered sets
- **For place value tasks**: Emphasize challenging teen numbers (11-19) where place value is less obvious than for 10 or 20
- **For pattern tasks**: Vary starting points (don't always start at 1 or 10), vary direction (forwards and backwards), vary step size (count by ones, later by twos)

## Visual Representation Guidance

Specify appropriate visual formats without providing code examples:

**When to use structured arrangements:**
- Ten-frames for numbers 1-20 (showing tens and ones clearly)
- Arrays in rows of 5 or 10 for easy counting
- Number lines for sequencing and ordering tasks
- Grouped objects (bundles of 10 sticks plus loose ones)

**When to use less structured formats:**
- Scattered dots or objects to practice systematic counting strategies
- Mixed arrangements to build flexibility
- Real-world images (classroom objects, nature items) for authentic counting

**For number symbols and writing:**
- Large, clear numerals for recognition tasks
- Dotted or traced numerals for writing practice prompts
- Comparison symbols (<, >, =) introduced gradually with visual support

## Language and Context Variety

The backend variation system handles context diversity. Focus your prompt energy on mathematical structure, not on generating different contexts. Trust that the variation system will provide rich scenarios (classroom, playground, nature, home, shopping, etc.).

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Do NOT:**
- Provide specific LaTeX formulas or code examples
- Use the same counting sequence (1, 2, 3...) repeatedly
- Always start counting tasks at 1 or end at 20
- Focus only on structured arrangements (include messy, scattered arrangements)
- Use only comparison questions in one direction (vary which side is larger)
- Present numbers in isolation without visual or contextual support for young learners
- Assume students can read complex word problems (keep language simple and clear)
- Use abstract symbols before concrete understanding is established

**DO:**
- Describe visual arrangements that support different counting strategies
- Vary starting points, ending points, and number ranges widely
- Include both forwards and backwards counting regularly
- Mix structured and unstructured visual presentations
- Connect to age-appropriate, familiar contexts from student experience
- Use encouraging, playful language appropriate for 6-7 year olds
- Build from concrete (objects) to pictorial (images) to abstract (symbols) gradually
