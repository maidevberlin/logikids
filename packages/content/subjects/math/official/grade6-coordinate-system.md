name: Coordinate System
description: Understanding the Cartesian coordinate system with all four quadrants, plotting and reading points with positive and negative coordinates, calculating distances, and describing geometric relationships
grade: 6
focus: Coordinate geometry and spatial reasoning
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and name the four quadrants of the coordinate system
  - Plot points with positive and negative coordinates accurately
  - Read and write coordinates of points in all four quadrants
  - Determine which quadrant a point belongs to based on its coordinates
  - Calculate horizontal and vertical distances between points
  - Describe positions and movements using coordinate notation
  - Identify geometric patterns and shapes on the coordinate plane
problem_types:
  - Point plotting
  - Coordinate reading
  - Quadrant identification
  - Distance calculation
  - Shape vertex identification
  - Reflection across axes
  - Movement description
  - Pattern completion
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Points in the first quadrant with coordinates up to 10
    - Simple coordinate reading from clearly marked grids
    - Identifying quadrants for points with integer coordinates
  medium:
    - Points in all four quadrants with coordinates from -10 to 10
    - Calculating distances along horizontal or vertical lines
    - Plotting vertices of simple shapes and identifying the shape
  hard:
    - Finding coordinates of reflected points across x-axis or y-axis
    - Determining missing vertices to complete geometric shapes
    - Multi-step problems combining plotting, distances, and patterns
prerequisites:
  - grade5-negative-numbers
  - grade5-geometry-basics
real_world_context:
  - Reading maps and GPS coordinates to locate places using latitude and longitude
  - Video game character positions on screen using x and y coordinates
  - Battleship-style games where positions are identified by coordinates
  - Graphing temperature changes over time with negative values in winter
  - Architecture and design using grid systems to place elements precisely
  - Chess notation using letter-number coordinates for moves
  - Spreadsheet cells identified by column letters and row numbers
  - Radar screens showing aircraft positions relative to center
  - Treasure maps with X and Y coordinates for hidden locations
  - Stadium seating using section and row coordinates
  - Minecraft building using block coordinates in 3D space
  - Drone navigation following programmed coordinate paths
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid coordinates with absolute values larger than 20
  - Don't introduce linear equations or slope concepts
  - Avoid decimal or fractional coordinates
  - Don't combine with advanced transformations like rotations
  - Avoid problems requiring the distance formula (Pythagorean theorem)
