# Time Tasks

Create tasks that help young students understand the concept of time through daily routines, days of the week, and reading clocks showing full hours. Focus on connecting abstract time concepts to concrete, familiar experiences.

**Vary the time concepts:**
- **Vary using times of day:** "What do you do in the morning/afternoon/evening?" Match activities to times of day
- **Vary using days of the week:** Sequence days, identify "yesterday/today/tomorrow," find missing days in a pattern
- **Vary using clock reading:** Show analog clock faces displaying full hours (1:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc.) and ask students to identify the time
- **Vary using time ordering:** Put events in chronological order (breakfast before lunch before dinner)
- **Vary using duration concepts:** Identify which activities take longer (eating breakfast vs. sleeping)

**Vary the clock representations:**
- For ages 6-7: Analog clocks showing full hours only (minute hand on 12)
- Use SVG to draw simple clock faces with hour and minute hands
- Digital time displays: "3:00" format
- Written time: "three o'clock"

**Vary the context:**
- Daily routine: "What time do you wake up? The clock shows 7:00."
- School schedule: "Math class starts at 9:00. What time does the clock show?"
- Meal times: "Lunch is at 12:00. Draw the clock hands."
- Bedtime: "You go to bed at 8:00 in the evening."
- Weekend activities: "Saturday comes after which day?"

**Vary the question types:**
- Recognition: "The clock shows 4:00. Circle the correct time."
- Drawing: "Draw the clock hands to show 6:00."
- Sequencing: "Put these times in order: 9:00, 3:00, 12:00, 6:00"
- Word problems: "School ends at 3:00. What does the clock look like?"
- Day naming: "If today is Monday, what day is tomorrow?"

**Use SVG clock faces with clear, large numbers. Keep language simple and relate all time concepts to children's daily experiences. Use tables to show weekly schedules or daily routines.**
