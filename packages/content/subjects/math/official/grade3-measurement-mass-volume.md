name: Measurement - Mass and Volume
description: Understanding and working with grams, kilograms, milliliters, and liters through measuring, comparing, and converting
grade: 3
focus: Mass and volume measurement
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Measure mass using grams and kilograms with appropriate tools
  - Measure volume using milliliters and liters with appropriate containers
  - Compare and order masses and volumes using standard units
  - Convert between grams and kilograms (1 kg = 1000 g)
  - Convert between milliliters and liters (1 L = 1000 mL)
  - Solve practical problems involving mass and volume measurements
  - Estimate reasonable masses and volumes of everyday objects
problem_types:
  - Mass measurement
  - Volume measurement
  - Unit conversion
  - Measurement comparison
  - Estimation tasks
  - Mass ordering
  - Volume ordering
  - Real-world applications
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Whole units only (e.g., 5 kg, 200 g, 3 L, 500 mL)
    - Simple conversions with round numbers (2 kg = 2000 g)
    - Objects with familiar masses/volumes (apple, water bottle)
  medium:
    - Combined units allowed (e.g., 1 kg 250 g, 2 L 300 mL)
    - Conversions requiring calculation (1500 g = ? kg)
    - Multiple comparisons or ordering tasks
  hard:
    - Multi-step conversions or calculations
    - Comparing different unit combinations (750 g vs 1 kg 200 g)
    - Problems requiring reasoning about capacity and weight relationships
prerequisites:
  - grade2-measurement-skills
real_world_context:
  - Weighing ingredients for cooking and baking recipes using kitchen scales
  - Measuring liquids like milk, juice, or water for drinks and cooking
  - Reading product labels showing mass (cereal box, fruit package) or volume (juice carton, shampoo bottle)
  - Comparing weights at the grocery store to choose fruit, vegetables, or bulk items
  - Understanding how much a backpack, pet, or sports equipment weighs
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid units beyond kg/g and L/mL (no metric tons, hectoliters, etc.)
  - Don't use decimal notation (use 1 kg 500 g, not 1.5 kg)
  - Avoid mixing mass and volume in comparison problems
  - Don't require knowledge of density or volume-mass relationships
  - Avoid imperial units (pounds, ounces, gallons, cups)
