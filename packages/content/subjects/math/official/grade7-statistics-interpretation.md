name: Statistics Interpretation and Analysis
description: Understanding measures of central tendency, data analysis, and statistical reasoning with real-world applications
grade: 7
ages:
  - 12
  - 13
focus: Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), range, various charts, comparing data sets
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Calculate and interpret mean (average) for data sets with various values
  - Identify and determine the median (middle value) for ordered data sets
  - Find the mode (most frequent value) and recognize when multiple modes exist
  - Calculate range and understand its role in describing data spread
  - Create and interpret histograms showing frequency distributions
  - Create and read stem-and-leaf plots for organizing and displaying data
  - Create and interpret box plots (quartiles, interquartile range, outliers)
  - Compare two or more data sets using measures of central tendency and spread
  - Identify and explain how outliers affect statistical measures
  - Recognize and identify misleading statistics and manipulative chart presentations
  - Make informed conclusions about data based on statistical analysis
prerequisites:
  - data-collection-charts
  - grade4-data-analysis-and-statistics
real_world_context: Statistics is fundamental to understanding information presented in media, making decisions in science and business, and interpreting research. Students at this level begin to understand that data rarely tells a complete story without careful analysis. They learn that the same data set can be presented in different ways to support different conclusions, making critical thinking about statistics essential for informed citizenship. Grade 7 students develop skill in calculating and comparing statistical measures, recognizing when statistics are used legitimately versus misleadingly, and understanding how data characteristics (like outliers) influence statistical conclusions used in sports, medicine, economics, environmental science, and public policy.

version_notes: Initial migration to frontmatter-based format. Extracted problem_types from prose section, age_guidelines from age-based scaffolding section, and difficulty_guidelines from variation principles throughout the content.
problem_types:
  - Calculate Central Tendency
  - Analyze Outlier Impact
  - Create Histograms
  - Interpret Stem-and-Leaf
  - Create Box Plots
  - Compare Data Sets
  - Analyze Distribution Shape
  - Critique Misleading Statistics
age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Focus on clear calculation procedures for mean, median, mode, and range
    - Use school-based contexts like test scores, heights, and survey responses
    - Limit data sets to 8-12 values for easy difficulty
    - Use whole numbers in most cases
    - Provide ordered data for median calculation when appropriate
    - Use histograms with equal, obvious interval widths
    - Explicitly guide when to use mean versus median
  13:
    - Expand to real-world scenarios including sports statistics and measurement comparisons
    - Work with larger data sets (10-20 values for medium, 30-50 for hard)
    - Include mixed whole numbers and simple decimals
    - Require students to calculate quartiles and identify outliers
    - Guide comparison statements using multiple statistical measures
    - Introduce complex distributions with multiple characteristics
    - Include analysis of deliberately misleading statistical presentations
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Calculate mean from small data sets (5-8 values) with whole numbers
    - Identify median from small, odd-numbered data sets (5-9 values) after ordering
    - Identify mode from data with obvious frequency differences
    - Calculate range by identifying max and min values
    - Read histograms with obvious, equal-width intervals
    - Read stem-and-leaf plots with straightforward structure
    - Direct visual comparison using similar chart types
    - Recognize when averages are chosen to support particular viewpoints
  medium:
    - Calculate mean from 8-20 values with mixed whole numbers and decimals
    - Determine how adding or removing data points changes the mean
    - Calculate median from data sets with 6-25 values, both odd and even sizes
    - Identify mode from data sets with 10-20+ values, including bimodal distributions
    - Calculate range and recognize limitations when outliers exist
    - Calculate Q1, Q2 (median), and Q3 from ordered data sets (12-20+ values)
    - Create histograms from raw data by choosing appropriate interval width
    - Create stem-and-leaf plots from unorganized data
    - Create box plots from ordered data by calculating five-number summary
    - Calculate and compare central tendency measures across groups
    - Identify chart axis manipulation and selection bias
  hard:
    - Calculate mean from larger data sets (20-50 values) with varied distributions
    - Analyze how outliers distort the mean and determine missing values when mean is known
    - Calculate median from grouped data presented in frequency tables
    - Understand quartiles dividing data into four equal parts
    - Interpret multimodal distributions with three or more equally common values
    - Explore interquartile range (IQR) as robust measure of middle 50% spread
    - Work with larger data sets (25+ values) to understand quartiles
    - Work with histograms showing relative frequency or unequal class widths
    - Create back-to-back stem-and-leaf plots comparing two groups
    - Interpret box plots showing identified outliers using 1.5×IQR rule
    - Use multiple statistical measures together to paint complete picture
    - Analyze statistical presentations to identify manipulation techniques
