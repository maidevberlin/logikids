# Numbers and Operations to 1000

Generate tasks that develop students' understanding of three-digit numbers and computation strategies, integrating place value concepts with addition and subtraction skills.

## Problem Type Variations

Create problems across these distinct structures to ensure comprehensive skill development:

### 1. Place Value Analysis and Decomposition
Ask students to break down numbers into place value components or identify specific digits. Vary whether you ask for hundreds, tens, ones separately or in combination. Include tasks asking students to build numbers from place value descriptions.

### 2. Number Representation Transformations
Present numbers in one form and require conversion to another: digit form to word form, expanded notation to standard form, or visual representations (base-ten blocks described verbally) to numerals. Reverse the direction of conversion frequently.

### 3. Comparing and Ordering
Provide sets of numbers for comparison. Vary set size (two numbers up to five numbers), and require different outputs: identify largest/smallest, arrange in ascending/descending order, or explain which is greater using place value reasoning.

### 4. Rounding Strategies
Present numbers for rounding to different precision levels (nearest ten, nearest hundred). Include scenarios where students choose appropriate rounding for context, or where they must explain why a number rounds up versus down.

### 5. Mental Addition Without Regrouping
Create addition problems where no carrying is required across place values. Students use strategies like adding hundreds to hundreds, tens to tens, and ones to ones separately, then combining results.

### 6. Mental Addition With Regrouping
Design addition where carrying occurs in one or more place values. Students apply strategies such as: breaking apart numbers by place value then regrouping, using compensation (adding to friendly number then adjusting), or making tens/hundreds first.

### 7. Mental Subtraction Without Regrouping
Present subtraction where no borrowing is needed. Students decompose by place value, subtract each position independently, then recombine.

### 8. Mental Subtraction With Regrouping
Create subtraction requiring borrowing across place values. Include problems where students choose between strategies: counting up (finding difference), equal differences (adjusting both numbers equally), or breaking apart with regrouping.

### 9. Estimation Before Calculation
Require students to estimate first using rounding, then compute exact answer, then compare estimate to actual result. Vary which place value to round to based on context and required precision.

### 10. Finding Unknown Values
Present equations with missing addends, subtrahends, or minuends. Students must work backward from results to find unknowns, applying inverse operation thinking.

### 11. Multi-Step Calculations
Combine multiple operations in sequence or require students to solve real-world scenarios involving both addition and subtraction with three-digit numbers.

## Age-Based Scaffolding

**For {{age}} < 9:**
- Focus on concrete place value understanding with simpler numbers (no zeros in middle positions initially)
- Provide more structured step-by-step prompts
- Use visual descriptions (imagine base-ten blocks) to support abstract thinking
- Limit to two-step reasoning maximum
- Emphasize estimation to friendly hundreds

**For {{age}} >= 9:**
- Include numbers with zeros in various positions, increasing abstract reasoning demands
- Present more open-ended problems requiring strategy selection
- Introduce multi-step reasoning combining several concepts
- Expect written explanation of chosen strategies
- Emphasize estimation to both tens and hundreds depending on context

## Difficulty Scaling

**When {{difficulty}} == "easy":**
- Numbers without zeros in middle positions for clarity
- Single regrouping maximum in addition/subtraction
- Explicit strategy suggestions provided
- Two-number comparisons
- Direct place value questions

**When {{difficulty}} == "medium":**
- Include zeros in various positions
- Multiple regrouping steps possible
- Students choose from familiar strategies
- Three to four number comparisons/ordering
- Combined concepts (round then add, estimate then compare)

**When {{difficulty}} == "hard":**
- Complex numbers with multiple zeros
- Require efficient strategy selection without prompting
- Multi-step problems combining several operations
- Five or more numbers to order
- Problems requiring justification of strategy choice
- Reverse reasoning (given answer, find possible numbers)

## Numerical Variation Principles

Generate diverse number combinations by:
- **Magnitude range:** Use full spectrum from 100 to 999, not clustering around specific values
- **Digit variety:** Include all digits 0-9 in various positions, ensuring zeros appear in tens and ones places as well as being absent
- **Regrouping patterns:** Systematically vary whether regrouping occurs in ones-to-tens, tens-to-hundreds, both, or neither
- **Sum/difference ranges:** Target results across low (100-300), middle (400-700), and high (800-1000) ranges
- **Rounding cases:** Include numbers just above rounding thresholds, just below, and exactly at midpoints to test understanding of rounding rules
- **Randomization:** Avoid arithmetic sequences or patterned selections; mix even and odd numbers unpredictably

## Representation and Format Guidance

**When to use mathematical expressions:**
- Display calculations using standard arithmetic notation (addition and subtraction symbols)
- Use inline notation for single expressions within sentence context
- Use block notation when showing multi-step work or when calculation is the primary focus

**When to use tables:**
- Comparing multiple numbers across several attributes (value, rounded to tens, rounded to hundreds)
- Showing before/after scenarios in multi-step problems
- Organizing data for comparison or ordering tasks

**When to describe visual models:**
- Reference number lines for showing jumps or intervals, describing positions and movements verbally
- Describe base-ten block arrangements (how many hundred-blocks, ten-rods, and one-units) to support place value understanding
- Explain position on scales or measurement contexts

**Language precision:**
- Use place value terminology consistently: hundreds place, tens place, ones place (not units)
- Distinguish between "digit" (single symbol) and "number" (complete value)
- Use precise comparison language: greater than, less than, equal to
- For rounding: "nearest ten" and "nearest hundred" (not approximately)

## Common Errors to Address

Design some tasks that reveal and correct typical misconceptions:
- Comparing numbers left-to-right digit by digit without place value consideration (thinking 245 > 62 because 2 < 6)
- Believing larger-looking numbers are always greater (more digits means bigger)
- Rounding incorrectly (always rounding up, or not knowing what to do with fives)
- In subtraction, always taking smaller digit from larger regardless of position
- Adding/subtracting digits in wrong place value columns
- Confusing which direction is "up" versus "down" when rounding

Include occasional problems specifically targeting these misconceptions to help students develop robust understanding.

## Context Integration

Embed calculations in meaningful scenarios appropriate for 8-9 year-olds:
- Money contexts using cents (up to 999 cents, converting to euros and cents)
- Distance measurement in meters (playground dimensions, running track lengths, hiking trails)
- Mass in grams (food packages, classroom supplies, science experiments)
- Time spans in minutes (school day duration, activity lengths)
- Collections and inventories (stamps, stickers, books in library)
- Sports statistics (points scored, attendance at games)
- Population of small towns or school enrollment figures

Vary whether context requires exact calculation or estimation is more appropriate, helping students develop sense of when each is needed.
