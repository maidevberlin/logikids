name: Numbers and Operations to 1000
description: Place value, comparing, ordering, rounding, mental addition and subtraction strategies with three-digit numbers
grade: 3
ages:
  - 8
  - 9
focus: Numbers and operations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand place value system for three-digit numbers (hundreds, tens, ones)
  - Compare and order numbers up to 1000 using place value reasoning
  - Round numbers to nearest ten and hundred
  - Add and subtract three-digit numbers using mental and semi-written strategies
  - Estimate sums and differences to check reasonableness of answers
prerequisites:
  - grade2-number-range-up-to-100
  - grade2-addition-and-subtraction-up-to-100
real_world_context: Working with three-digit numbers is essential for understanding money in cents and euros, measuring distances in meters, calculating with masses in grams, reading house numbers and postcodes, and interpreting data in tables and graphs.
problem_types:
  - Place value decomposition
  - Number representation
  - Comparing and ordering
  - Rounding strategies
  - Addition without regrouping
  - Addition with regrouping
  - Subtraction without regrouping
  - Subtraction with regrouping
  - Estimation tasks
  - Finding unknown values
age_guidelines:
  8:
    - Focus on concrete place value understanding with simpler numbers (no zeros in middle positions initially)
    - Provide more structured step-by-step prompts
    - Use visual descriptions (imagine base-ten blocks) to support abstract thinking
    - Limit to two-step reasoning maximum
    - Emphasize estimation to friendly hundreds
  9:
    - Include numbers with zeros in various positions, increasing abstract reasoning demands
    - Present more open-ended problems requiring strategy selection
    - Introduce multi-step reasoning combining several concepts
    - Expect written explanation of chosen strategies
    - Emphasize estimation to both tens and hundreds depending on context
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Numbers without zeros in middle positions for clarity
    - Single regrouping maximum in addition/subtraction
    - Explicit strategy suggestions provided
    - Two-number comparisons
    - Direct place value questions
  medium:
    - Include zeros in various positions
    - Multiple regrouping steps possible
    - Students choose from familiar strategies
    - Three to four number comparisons/ordering
    - Combined concepts (round then add, estimate then compare)
  hard:
    - Complex numbers with multiple zeros
    - Require efficient strategy selection without prompting
    - Multi-step problems combining several operations
    - Five or more numbers to order
    - Problems requiring justification of strategy choice
    - Reverse reasoning (given answer, find possible numbers)
