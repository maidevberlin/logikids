description: Understanding power notation as repeated multiplication, applying power laws including product rule, quotient rule, and power of power, simplifying expressions with integer exponents, and working with powers of variables
grade: 7
focus: Power notation and power laws
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand and apply power notation as repeated multiplication
  - Apply the product rule for powers with the same base (a^m × a^n = a^(m+n))
  - Apply the quotient rule for powers with the same base (a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n))
  - Apply the power of a power rule ((a^m)^n = a^(m×n))
  - Calculate powers with negative integer exponents using reciprocal relationships
  - Simplify complex expressions by combining multiple power laws
  - Work with powers of variables in algebraic expressions
problem_types:
  - Power evaluation
  - Product rule application
  - Quotient rule application
  - Power of power
  - Negative exponent conversion
  - Power law combination
  - Variable power simplification
  - Base and exponent identification
  - Expression comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Evaluate simple powers with small bases and exponents up to 4 (e.g., 2^3, 5^2)
    - Apply single power law to expressions with numerical bases
    - Convert between negative exponents and fractions (e.g., 3^-2 = 1/9)
  medium:
    - Apply two power laws in sequence to simplify expressions
    - Work with powers of 10 and scientific notation context
    - Simplify expressions with variables and exponents up to 5
  hard:
    - Combine three or more power laws in multi-step simplification
    - Work with both positive and negative exponents in same expression
    - Simplify complex algebraic expressions with multiple variables and powers
prerequisites:
  - grade6-rational-multiplication-division
  - grade6-combined-operations
real_world_context:
  - Scientific notation for expressing very large numbers (distances in space) or very small numbers (microscopic measurements)
  - Compound interest calculations where money grows exponentially over time periods
  - Population growth models showing how quantities multiply repeatedly
  - Computer data storage where each step up doubles capacity (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes)
  - Cell division in biology where organisms grow by repeated doubling
  - Sound intensity measured in decibels using powers of 10
  - Earthquake magnitude scales comparing energy release exponentially
  - Password security strength doubling with each additional character
  - Viral content spreading through social networks with exponential reach
  - Chemical decay processes where substances reduce by powers over time
  - Tournament brackets where rounds reduce teams by powers of 2
  - Photo resolution increasing by powers of 2 in megapixels
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing addition/subtraction with power operations in same problem
  - Don't use bases larger than 10 or exponents beyond ±5 for numerical calculations
  - Avoid fractional or decimal exponents (keep to integer exponents only)
  - Don't combine different bases in power law applications
  - Avoid expressions requiring order of operations beyond power laws
