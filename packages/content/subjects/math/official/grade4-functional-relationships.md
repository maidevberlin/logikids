# Functional Relationships

Create tasks that help students recognize and represent relationships between quantities using tables and proportional reasoning.

## Problem Variations

**Variation 1: Simple Proportional Relationship**
Complete the table showing the relationship between quantity and price:

{{item_name}} costs ${{price_per_unit}}$ per {{unit}}.

| Quantity ({{unit}}) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | {{custom_quantity}} |
|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---------------------|
| Price | {{p1}} | {{p2}} | ? | ? | ? | ? |

Find the pattern: Price = Quantity × ${{price_per_unit}}$

**Variation 2: Real-World Shopping Problem**
At the farmer's market, apples cost ${{price}}$ per kilogram.

a) How much do ${{quantity}}$ kg of apples cost?
b) If you have ${{budget}}$, how many kilograms can you buy?

Solution:
- Part a: ${{quantity}} \times {{price}} = {{total}}$
- Part b: ${{budget}} \div {{price}} = {{max_kg}}$ kg

**Variation 3: Time and Distance Relationship**
A cyclist travels at a constant speed of ${{speed}}$ km per hour.

Complete the table:

| Time (hours) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Distance (km) | {{d1}} | {{d2}} | ? | ? | ? |

Rule: Distance = Time × Speed = Time × ${{speed}}$

**Variation 4: Identify the Rule**
Look at this table and find the relationship between Input and Output:

| Input | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|-----|
| Output | {{o1}} | {{o2}} | {{o3}} | {{o4}} | {{o5}} |

What is the rule? (Example: Output = Input × 3, or Output = Input + 5)

**Variation 5: Multiple Rate Problems**
A bakery sells different items:

| Item | Price per piece |
|------|-----------------|
| Bread rolls | ${{price_rolls}}$ |
| Croissants | ${{price_croissants}}$ |
| Muffins | ${{price_muffins}}$ |

Create a table showing the total cost for different quantities:

| Quantity | Bread rolls | Croissants | Muffins |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | ? | ? | ? |
| 3 | ? | ? | ? |
| 5 | ? | ? | ? |

**Variation 6: Inverse Thinking**
A candy store sells chocolates for ${{price}}$ each.

If you spent ${{total_spent}}$, how many chocolates did you buy?

Work backwards: Number of chocolates = Total spent ÷ Price per chocolate

$$\text{Chocolates} = {{total_spent}} \div {{price}} = {{quantity}}$$

**Variation 7: Comparing Two Relationships**
Store A sells notebooks for ${{price_a}}$ each.
Store B sells notebooks for ${{price_b}}$ each.

Create comparison tables for 1, 3, 5, and 10 notebooks:

| Quantity | Store A | Store B | Difference |
|----------|---------|---------|------------|
| 1 | ? | ? | ? |
| 3 | ? | ? | ? |
| 5 | ? | ? | ? |
| 10 | ? | ? | ? |

Which store offers better value for buying {{specific_quantity}} notebooks?

**Variation 8: Multi-Step Function Problem**
A recipe serves {{servings_base}} people and requires ${{amount}}$ {{ingredient}}.

a) Complete the table for different numbers of people:

| People | {{servings_base}} | {{s2}} | {{s3}} | {{s4}} |
|--------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| {{ingredient}} needed | {{amount}} | ? | ? | ? |

b) How much {{ingredient}} is needed for {{target_servings}} people?

Rule: Amount needed = (People ÷ {{servings_base}}) × {{amount}}
