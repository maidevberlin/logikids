name: Length Measurement
description: Measuring with mm, cm, m, km; unit conversions; estimation and comparison of lengths
grade: 3
focus: Length measurement and unit conversions
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Measure objects accurately using mm, cm, dm, m, and km
  - Convert between metric length units (mm, cm, dm, m, km)
  - Estimate lengths before measuring and verify accuracy
  - Compare and order lengths using different units
  - Understand the relationship between place value and metric conversions
  - Solve practical problems involving length measurement
problem_types:
  - Unit conversion
  - Measurement reading
  - Estimation challenges
  - Length comparison
  - Missing measurement
  - Tool selection
  - Mixed unit problems
  - Multi-step measurement
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single unit measurements (only cm or only m)
    - Adjacent unit conversions (cm↔m, m↔km)
    - Common objects with familiar sizes
  medium:
    - Mixed notation (2 m 35 cm)
    - Conversions across two steps (dm to mm)
    - Estimation with verification
  hard:
    - Multi-step conversions (km to cm)
    - Complex comparison across different units
    - Word problems combining measurement and calculation
real_world_context:
  - Measuring classroom objects like desks, books, and pencils with rulers
  - Calculating room dimensions for arranging furniture or laying carpet
  - Planning travel distances for family trips or school excursions
  - Comparing heights of classmates, buildings, or trees
  - Estimating and measuring ingredients or materials for craft projects
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid non-metric units (inches, feet, miles)
  - Don't use decimal notation for mixed units (write 2 m 35 cm, not 2.35 m)
  - Avoid conversions requiring more than 3 steps
  - Don't combine area or volume measurements with length
  - Avoid measurement tools unfamiliar to 8-9 year olds (calipers, laser measures)
prerequisites:
  - grade2-measurement-skills
  - grade3-numbers-to-1000
version: 1
version_notes: Initial version aligned with KMK Bildungsstandards for Grade 3
