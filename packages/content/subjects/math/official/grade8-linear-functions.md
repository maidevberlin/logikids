name: Linear Functions
description: Understanding and working with linear functions y = mx + t, including graphing, interpreting slope and y-intercept, finding zeros and intersection points, and solving linear inequalities.
grade: 8
focus: Linear relationships and algebraic representation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Interpret and graph linear functions in the form y = mx + t
  - Determine slope (m) and y-intercept (t) from graphs and tables
  - Find zeros and intersection points of linear functions
  - Solve linear inequalities and express solutions in interval notation
  - Set up linear equations from real-world situations
  - Recognize direct proportionality as a special case where t = 0
  - Analyze how parameter changes affect linear function graphs
problem_types:
  - Graphing from equation
  - Finding slope and intercept
  - Determining equation from graph
  - Calculating zeros
  - Intersection points
  - Linear inequalities
  - Real-world modeling
  - Parameter interpretation
  - Direct proportionality
  - Parallel and perpendicular lines
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Use integer values for m and t (slope and y-intercept)
    - Simple grids with clear scale (e.g., increments of 1 or 2)
    - Positive slopes for graphing tasks
  medium:
    - Include fractional or decimal values for m and t
    - Negative slopes and y-intercepts
    - Solve inequalities requiring algebraic manipulation
  hard:
    - Multiple-step problems combining several concepts (e.g., find equation, then solve inequality)
    - Complex real-world scenarios requiring equation setup
    - Finding equations from two points or one point and slope
prerequisites:
  - grade7-linear-equations
  - grade7-proportionality
  - grade6-coordinate-system
real_world_context:
  - Cell phone plans with base fee and per-minute charges model linear functions
  - Temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit follows a linear relationship
  - Taxi fares with fixed starting fee plus distance-based cost
  - Savings accounts with initial deposit and regular monthly contributions
  - Speed and distance relationships in uniform motion (d = vt + d₀)
  - Gym memberships with monthly fees plus initial signup costs
  - Printing costs combining fixed setup fees with per-page charges
  - Freelancer billing with hourly rates plus project startup fees
  - Rental car costs with daily rates plus mileage fees
  - Electricity bills combining base charges with per-kilowatt-hour usage
  - Tutoring services with assessment fees plus hourly session rates
  - Streaming data plans with base data plus overage charges per gigabyte
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid non-linear functions or curves disguised as lines
  - Don't use slopes steeper than 5 or flatter than 0.1 for graphing tasks
  - Avoid fractional slopes with denominators larger than 10
  - Don't combine systems of equations (covered separately)
  - Keep inequality solutions to single variables, not compound inequalities
