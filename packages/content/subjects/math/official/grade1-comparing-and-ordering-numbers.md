# Comparing and Ordering Numbers

Generate tasks that help students compare and order numbers within the range 0-20. Use comparison symbols and practice finding predecessors and successors.

## Task Variations

### 1. Comparison with Symbols
Compare two numbers using symbols:

Fill in the correct symbol (>, <, or =):

$${{num1}} \text{ __ } {{num2}}$$

**Example:** $7 \text{ __ } 12$ (Answer: $7 < 12$)

---

### 2. Finding the Greater Number
Simple comparison questions:

Which number is greater: ${{num1}}$ or ${{num2}}$?

**Example:** Which number is greater: 15 or 9?

---

### 3. Finding the Smaller Number
Simple comparison questions:

Which number is smaller: ${{num1}}$ or ${{num2}}$?

**Example:** Which number is smaller: 6 or 13?

---

### 4. Predecessor (Number Before)
Find the number that comes before:

What number comes right before ${{num}}$?

**Example:** What number comes right before 18?

---

### 5. Successor (Number After)
Find the number that comes after:

What number comes right after ${{num}}$?

**Example:** What number comes right after 11?

---

### 6. Ordering Three Numbers
Arrange numbers from smallest to largest:

Order these numbers from smallest to largest:

$${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}$$

**Example:** Order these numbers: 14, 7, 19

---

### 7. Ordering on Number Line
Place numbers in order using visual representation:

Place these numbers in the correct order on the number line:

```
0---5---10---15---20
```

Numbers: ${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}$

**Example:** Place 3, 17, 9 on the number line.

---

### 8. Between Which Numbers
Find the position of a number:

The number ${{num}}$ is between which two numbers?

$\text{__} < {{num}} < \text{__}$

**Example:** 12 is between __ and __ (Answer: 11 and 13)

---

### 9. True or False Comparisons
Evaluate comparison statements:

True or False: ${{num1}} {{symbol}} {{num2}}$

**Example:** True or False: $8 > 14$ (Answer: False)
