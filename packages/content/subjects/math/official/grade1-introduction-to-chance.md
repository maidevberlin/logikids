# Introduction to Chance

Generate tasks that help students understand basic probability concepts: certain, possible, and impossible events. Use simple random experiments like dice and coins that are familiar to first graders.

## Task Variations

### 1. Certain, Possible, or Impossible
Classify events by their likelihood:

Is this event **certain**, **possible**, or **impossible**?

{{event_description}}

**Examples:**
- The sun will rise tomorrow (Certain)
- It will rain next week (Possible)
- A cat will bark (Impossible)

---

### 2. Dice Outcomes
Understand possible outcomes with dice:

You roll a standard dice (with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

Is it **possible** or **impossible** to roll a {{number}}?

**Example:** Is it possible to roll a 7? (Impossible)

---

### 3. Coin Flip Outcomes
Understand coin flipping:

When you flip a coin, what can happen?

Circle all **possible** outcomes:
- Heads
- Tails
- Both at the same time
- Standing on edge

**Example:** Only heads or tails are possible in normal situations.

---

### 4. Identifying Impossible Events
Recognize events that cannot happen:

Circle the **impossible** event:

a) {{possible_event_1}}
b) {{impossible_event}}
c) {{possible_event_2}}

**Example:**
a) A fish can swim
b) A dog can drive a car
c) A bird can fly

---

### 5. Identifying Certain Events
Recognize events that must happen:

Circle the **certain** event:

a) {{uncertain_event_1}}
b) {{certain_event}}
c) {{uncertain_event_2}}

**Example:**
a) It will snow today
b) The sun will set tonight
c) You will find treasure

---

### 6. Bag of Objects
Simple probability with objects:

A bag contains: 🔴 🔴 🔵 🔴

If you pick one object without looking, is it **certain**, **possible**, or **impossible** to pick:

- A red ball?
- A blue ball?
- A green ball?

---

### 7. True or False About Chance
Test understanding of probability:

True or False: {{probability_statement}}

**Examples:**
- "When you flip a coin, you will always get heads." (False)
- "A dice can show any number from 1 to 6." (True)
- "It is impossible for birds to fly." (False)

---

### 8. Predicting Outcomes
Make simple predictions:

What will **definitely happen** when you drop a ball?

a) It will fly up to the sky
b) It will fall down
c) It will disappear

**Example:** The ball will fall down (certain due to gravity)

---

### 9. Sorting Events
Classify multiple events:

Sort these events into three groups:

**Certain** | **Possible** | **Impossible**

Events:
- {{event1}}
- {{event2}}
- {{event3}}
- {{event4}}

**Example:** Sort: "Night follows day", "Finding a four-leaf clover", "A rock can talk"
