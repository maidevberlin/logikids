# Mean (Average) - Problem Variations

Generate tasks that help students understand and calculate the arithmetic mean in various contexts.

## Variation 1: School Grades Average
A student has the following grades in math: ${{grade1}}$, ${{grade2}}$, ${{grade3}}$, ${{grade4}}$, and ${{grade5}}$. Calculate the average grade. Round to one decimal place if necessary.

**Example values:** grades 2, 3, 2, 1, 3 → Average = $(2+3+2+1+3) \div 5 = 11 \div 5 = 2.2$

## Variation 2: Temperature Data
The temperatures during one week were:

| Day | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| °C  | {{t1}} | {{t2}} | {{t3}} | {{t4}} | {{t5}} | {{t6}} | {{t7}} |

What was the average temperature for the week?

**Example values:** 18°C, 22°C, 20°C, 19°C, 21°C, 23°C, 20°C → Average = $143 \div 7 = 20.4°C$

## Variation 3: Points in Games
Max played {{num_games}} games and scored the following points: ${{score1}}$, ${{score2}}$, ${{score3}}$, ${{score4}}$, and ${{score5}}$ points. How many points did he score on average per game?

**Example values:** 15, 12, 18, 14, 16 points → Average = $(15+12+18+14+16) \div 5 = 75 \div 5 = 15$ points

## Variation 4: Finding Missing Values
Lisa has written {{num_tests}} tests so far and achieved an average of ${{target_avg}}$ points. She scored ${{score1}}$, ${{score2}}$, and ${{score3}}$ points in the first three tests. How many points did she score in the fourth test?

**Example:** Average 8 points over 4 tests, first three: 7, 9, 8 → Total needed: $8 \times 4 = 32$, already has $7+9+8=24$, missing: $32-24=8$ points

## Variation 5: Money Savings
Emma saved money for {{num_weeks}} weeks. In the table you can see how much she saved each week:

| Week | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Euro | {{w1}} | {{w2}} | {{w3}} | {{w4}} | {{w5}} |

How much did she save on average per week?

**Example values:** 5€, 8€, 6€, 7€, 9€ → Average = $(5+8+6+7+9) \div 5 = 35 \div 5 = 7€$

## Variation 6: Sports Performance
A soccer player scored goals in {{num_matches}} matches: ${{g1}}$, ${{g2}}$, ${{g3}}$, ${{g4}}$, ${{g5}}$, ${{g6}}$ goals. Calculate the average number of goals per match.

**Example values:** 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 4 goals → Average = $(2+1+3+0+2+4) \div 6 = 12 \div 6 = 2$ goals per match

## Variation 7: Height Measurements
Five friends measured their height:

| Name | Anna | Ben | Clara | David | Emma |
|------|------|-----|-------|-------|------|
| Height (cm) | {{h1}} | {{h2}} | {{h3}} | {{h4}} | {{h5}} |

What is the average height of the group?

**Example values:** 142 cm, 138 cm, 145 cm, 140 cm, 135 cm → Average = $(142+138+145+140+135) \div 5 = 700 \div 5 = 140$ cm

## Variation 8: Reading Pages
Tom read a book for {{num_days}} days. He read ${{p1}}$, ${{p2}}$, ${{p3}}$, ${{p4}}$, and ${{p5}}$ pages each day. How many pages did he read on average per day? If the book has ${{total_pages}}$ pages total, will he finish it by reading this average daily for 7 more days?

**Example values:** 24, 18, 30, 21, 27 pages → Average = $(24+18+30+21+27) \div 5 = 120 \div 5 = 24$ pages/day. In 7 days: $24 \times 7 = 168$ pages
