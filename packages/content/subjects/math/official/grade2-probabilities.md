# Probabilities

Generate a task where {{name}} compares probabilities in simple random experiments appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Use varied contexts:

**Dice and Coins:**
- Compare probabilities of different outcomes when rolling a die
- Example: "When rolling a normal die, what is more likely: rolling a number greater than $4$ or rolling an even number?"
- Use language like "more likely," "less likely," "equally likely," "certain," "impossible"

**Drawing from Containers:**
- Compare probabilities when drawing from bags, boxes, or containers with different colored objects
- Example: "A bag contains $7$ green marbles and $3$ yellow marbles. Which color are you more likely to draw?"
- Vary the numbers of objects to create different probability scenarios

**Spinners:**
- Create scenarios with spinners divided into different colored sections
- Example: "A spinner has $6$ sections: $4$ are blue and $2$ are red. Which color is the spinner more likely to land on?"
- Use simple fractions of a circle that students can visualize

**Everyday Events:**
- Compare probabilities of familiar events
- Example: "What is more likely: it will rain tomorrow or the sun will rise tomorrow?"
- Use events students can reason about: "seeing a dog on the way to school" vs "seeing a dinosaur"

**Number Cards:**
- Compare probabilities when drawing number cards
- Example: "You have cards numbered $1$ to $10$. Is it more likely to draw a number less than $5$ or greater than $7$?"

**Multiple Comparisons:**
- Present scenarios where students compare three or more outcomes
- Example: "A bag has $5$ red balls, $3$ blue balls, and $2$ green balls. Order these colors from most likely to least likely to be drawn."

**Certain and Impossible Events:**
- Include tasks that identify events that are certain or impossible
- Example: "Which of these is certain when rolling a die: getting a number less than $10$, getting exactly $4$, or getting a number greater than $6$?"

**Visual Representations:**
- When helpful, describe simple visual representations using tables or lists
- Show all possible outcomes clearly

| Outcome | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Red | $6$ |
| Blue | $4$ |

Use appropriate mathematical language for grade 2: "more likely," "less likely," "equally likely," "certain," "impossible," "chance," "possible outcomes."

Ensure the task is age-appropriate and uses concrete objects or familiar situations that 7-8 year olds can relate to.
