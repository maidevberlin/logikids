id: area-perimeter
name: Area and Perimeter
description: Calculating perimeter and area of rectangles and squares, understanding units, converting between area units, solving practical problems
grade: 5
ages:
  - 10
  - 11
focus: Measurement and calculation (Größen und Messen)
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Calculate perimeter and area of rectangles and squares
  - Convert between different area units (mm², cm², m², km²)
  - Solve real-world problems involving area and perimeter calculations
  - Estimate areas of irregular shapes and verify calculations
  - Understand the relationship between linear and square units
  - Apply area and perimeter concepts in practical contexts
prerequisites:
  - grade3-geometry-and-area
  - grade4-written-multiplication-and-division
real_world_context: Area and perimeter calculations are essential in everyday life for measuring rooms and floors, planning gardens and landscaping, calculating paint or wallpaper needs, designing playgrounds, wrapping packages, determining fabric requirements for sewing projects, comparing property sizes, and understanding construction plans. These concepts bridge mathematics with practical problem-solving in home improvement, architecture, and spatial planning.
problem_types:
  - Direct Calculation
  - Reverse Problems
  - Missing Dimension
  - Unit Conversion
  - Comparison Tasks
  - Composite Shapes
  - Optimization Problems
  - Real-World Applications
  - Multi-Step Problems
  - Estimation Challenges
age_guidelines:
  10:
    - Use whole number measurements primarily (meters, centimeters)
    - Focus on simpler unit conversions (cm² to m², avoiding very large or small numbers)
    - Provide clear diagrams with labeled dimensions
    - Use familiar contexts (bedroom, backyard, school playground)
    - Single-step or two-step problems predominantly
    - Emphasize one concept at a time (either area or perimeter, not combined)
    - Keep numbers manageable for mental or written multiplication (dimensions under 20)
  11:
    - Introduce decimal measurements (e.g., 3.5 m)
    - Include more complex unit conversions (mm² to cm², km² to m²)
    - Use less detailed diagrams; rely more on verbal descriptions
    - Include less familiar contexts (building plots, agricultural fields)
    - Multi-step problems combining area, perimeter, and unit conversion
    - Problems requiring both area and perimeter calculations
    - Larger numbers requiring standard multiplication algorithms
    - Include fractional dimensions where appropriate (e.g., half-meters)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Calculate area or perimeter of rectangles/squares with clearly given dimensions
    - Simple unit conversions with small conversion factors (cm² to mm²)
    - Direct application of formulas with whole numbers
    - Single concept focus (area only or perimeter only)
    - Clear visual representations provided
    - Dimensions are multiplication-friendly numbers (5, 10, 12)
  medium:
    - Find missing dimensions given area or perimeter
    - Convert between units with larger factors (cm² to m²)
    - Two-step problems combining calculation and conversion
    - Compare multiple shapes by area and perimeter
    - Simple composite shapes (two rectangles)
    - Word problems requiring interpretation and planning
    - Dimensions requiring standard multiplication
  hard:
    - Multi-step optimization problems
    - Complex unit conversions (mm² to m²)
    - Composite shapes with three or more rectangles
    - Problems requiring both area and perimeter with constraints
    - Real-world contexts requiring assumptions and estimation
    - Problems with fractional or decimal dimensions
    - Cost calculations involving rates per unit area or length
    - Problems where strategy and planning are essential
