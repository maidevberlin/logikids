# Mass Tasks

Create measurement tasks that help students understand mass units (gram, kilogram, tonne), estimate weights of everyday objects, and convert between different units. Focus on practical applications in cooking, shopping, and everyday situations.

**Vary the unit types:**
- **Vary using grams (g):** Small items like a pencil ($20g$), an apple ($150g$), a chocolate bar ($100g$)
- **Vary using kilograms (kg):** Medium items like a bag of flour ($1kg$), a watermelon ($3kg$), a person ($40kg$)
- **Vary using tonnes (t):** Large items like a car ($1.5t$), an elephant ($5t$), a truck ($12t$)
- **Vary using mixed units:** Convert between g and kg, or kg and t

**Vary the conversion problems:**
- **Vary g to kg:** "How many grams are in 3 kilograms?" Use $3kg = 3000g$ or $1kg = 1000g$, so $3 \times 1000 = 3000g$
- **Vary kg to g:** "A recipe needs 250g of flour. How many kg is that?" Use $250g = 0.25kg$ or $250g \div 1000 = 0.25kg$
- **Vary kg to t:** "A truck weighs 8000 kg. How many tonnes?" Use $8000kg = 8t$ or $1t = 1000kg$, so $8000 \div 1000 = 8t$
- **Vary addition/subtraction:** "You buy 500g of cheese and 750g of ham. What's the total mass?" Use $500g + 750g = 1250g = 1.25kg$

**Vary the estimation tasks:**
- **Vary comparing objects:** "Which weighs more: a feather or a book?" or "Does a bicycle weigh about 10g, 10kg, or 10t?"
- **Vary realistic estimates:** "Estimate the weight of your backpack: 500g, 5kg, or 50kg?"
- **Vary ordering by mass:** Arrange items from lightest to heaviest: eraser, textbook, desk, car
- **Vary choosing appropriate units:** "Would you measure a strawberry in grams or kilograms?"

**Vary the context:**
- Recipe scaling: "A cake recipe needs 500g sugar. You want to make 3 cakes. How much sugar total?" Use $500g \times 3 = 1500g = 1.5kg$
- Shopping problems: "You buy 2kg of apples at $3.00€$ per kg. How much do you pay?" Use $2kg \times 3.00€ = 6.00€$
- Grocery weight: "A bag holds 2kg. You add 350g of oranges. What's the total?" Use $2kg + 350g = 2000g + 350g = 2350g = 2.35kg$
- Package shipping: "A package weighs 1.8kg. Shipping costs $2€$ per kg. Total cost?" Use $1.8kg \times 2€ = 3.60€$
- Animal weights: "A cat weighs 4.5kg. A dog weighs 12kg. What's the difference?" Use $12kg - 4.5kg = 7.5kg$
- Vehicle loads: "A car weighs 1.2 tonnes. How many kilograms?" Use $1.2t = 1200kg$

**Vary the representation:**
- Use tables to show conversion factors: $1kg = 1000g$, $1t = 1000kg$
- Create comparison charts with common objects and their masses
- Use number lines to show relationships between units
- Include SVG scale diagrams showing balanced weights

**Use LaTeX for all measurements and conversions: $2kg = 2000g$. Create tables with unit conversion reference. Keep word problems practical and relatable to cooking, shopping, and daily life experiences.**
