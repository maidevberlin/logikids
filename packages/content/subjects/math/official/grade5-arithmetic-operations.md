name: Arithmetic Operations
description: Written methods for all four operations, order of operations, estimation and verification
grade: 5
focus: Multi-digit operations and calculation strategies
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Master written multiplication with multi-digit factors
  - Master written division with two-digit divisors
  - Apply order of operations (brackets, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction)
  - Estimate results before calculating for verification
  - Solve multi-step calculations
  - Check results using inverse operations
problem_types:
  - Written multiplication
  - Written division
  - Order of operations
  - Multi-step calculations
  - Estimation practice
  - Result verification
  - Missing operand problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Two operations maximum, no brackets required
    - Clear operation order without ambiguity
    - Numbers under 1000 for multiplication and division
  medium:
    - Three operations with simple brackets
    - Estimation required before calculation
    - Two-digit divisors and three-digit multipliers
  hard:
    - Four or more operations with nested brackets
    - Verification using inverse operations required
    - Multi-digit multiplication and division combined
real_world_context:
  - Shopping calculations with multiple items and quantities
  - Dividing items or costs equally among groups of people
  - Calculating total costs with quantities and unit prices
  - Computing sports statistics and team averages
  - Planning a party budget with food, decorations, and entertainment costs
  - A bakery calculating ingredients for multiple batches of cookies
  - Distributing prize money equally among tournament winners
  - Computing travel costs including fuel, tolls, and parking
  - Calculating points in a video game with bonuses and multipliers
  - A librarian organizing books into equal stacks for different shelves
  - Planning seating arrangements for a school assembly
  - Computing total ticket sales and revenue for a school play
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid fractions or decimals (separate concepts)
  - Don't use more than 3 levels of nested brackets
  - Avoid ambiguous expressions without clear precedence
  - Don't exceed 6-digit results
prerequisites:
  - grade4-written-multiplication-division
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 4 to 12 items for better variety
