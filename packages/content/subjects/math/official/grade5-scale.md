# Scale

Create tasks where {{child_name}} works with scale ratios in maps, plans, and models appropriate for grade 5 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Understanding Scale Ratios**: Explain what a scale means. "A map has scale {{1:10,000}}. What does this mean?" or "On a model with scale {{1:50}}, {{1}} cm represents __ cm in reality." Use scales like {{1:100}}, {{1:1,000}}, {{1:10,000}}, {{1:50,000}}.

2. **Map to Reality Calculations**: Given map distance and scale, find actual distance. "On a map with scale {{1:25,000}}, two towns are {{6}} cm apart. What is the actual distance in {{km/m}}?" Vary the scale and map distance ({{3-12}} cm).

3. **Reality to Map Calculations**: Given actual distance and scale, find map distance. "The actual distance between two points is {{500}} m. On a map with scale {{1:10,000}}, how far apart are they in cm?" Ensure unit conversions (m to cm, km to m).

4. **Floor Plans**: Use scale {{1:100}} or {{1:50}} for room dimensions. "A room measures {{4}} cm × {{3}} cm on a floor plan with scale {{1:100}}. What are the actual dimensions in meters?" Include conversion from cm to m.

5. **Model Scales**: Work with models (cars, trains, buildings). "A model train is built at scale {{1:87}}. If the model is {{12}} cm long, how long is the real train in meters?" Use common model scales: {{1:24}}, {{1:50}}, {{1:87}}, {{1:100}}.

6. **Comparing Scales**: Compare different representations. "Which map shows more detail: one with scale {{1:10,000}} or {{1:50,000}}?" or "You need to show a whole city on one page. Which scale is better: {{1:5,000}} or {{1:50,000}}?"

7. **Area with Scale**: Calculate actual area from scaled measurements. "A garden measures {{5}} cm × {{4}} cm on a plan with scale {{1:200}}. What is the actual area in m²?" Requires both scaling length and calculating area.

8. **Multi-Step Problems**: Combine scale calculations with other operations. "On a map with scale {{1:20,000}}, a rectangular park is {{3}} cm by {{2}} cm. What is the actual perimeter of the park in meters?" Vary whether to find length, area, or perimeter.

Use common scales: {{1:100}} (floor plans), {{1:10,000}} to {{1:50,000}} (city/regional maps), {{1:24}} to {{1:100}} (models). Include unit conversions: cm ↔ m ↔ km. Present calculations in both directions (map to reality and reality to map). Use tables to organize given information and calculations:

| Map Distance | Scale | Actual Distance |
|---|---|---|
| {{value}} | {{ratio}} | ? |

Emphasize that smaller scale number (like {{1:100}}) means larger representation than bigger scale number (like {{1:10,000}}).
