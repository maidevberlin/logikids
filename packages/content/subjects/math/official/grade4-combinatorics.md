id: grade4-combinatorics
name: Combinatorics and Systematic Counting
description: Finding all possibilities systematically using tree diagrams, organized lists, and tables to solve combination and arrangement problems
grade: 4
focus: Systematic problem-solving and combinatorial thinking
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Find all possible combinations or arrangements systematically without missing or repeating options
  - Use organized lists and tables to track and count possibilities
  - Understand and create tree diagrams as a tool for visualizing combinations
  - Apply systematic strategies to solve problems involving selection from multiple categories
  - Solve simple permutation problems where order matters
  - Recognize when to use different organizational tools (lists, tables, trees) for different problem types
problem_types:
  - Two-category combinations
  - Three-category combinations
  - Ordering and arrangements
  - Path counting
  - Meal planning
  - Outfit selection
  - Team formation
  - Constraint problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - 2 categories with 2-3 options each (6-9 total possibilities)
    - Direct listing or simple table
    - Concrete contexts like clothing or food
  medium:
    - 3 categories with 2-3 options each (8-27 possibilities)
    - Tree diagrams or systematic tables required
    - Multiple paths or routes
  hard:
    - Ordering/arrangement problems where sequence matters
    - Constraints like "not allowed together"
    - Finding missing combinations or identifying errors in incomplete lists
prerequisites:
  - grade4-patterns-equations
  - grade3-multiplication-tables
real_world_context:
  - Planning outfits by combining shirts, pants, and shoes from your wardrobe
  - Creating meal plans by choosing main dish, side dish, and drink options
  - Finding all possible routes from home to school using different streets
  - Organizing teams or groups with specific requirements
  - Planning activities by combining different options like sports, times, and locations
  - An ice cream shop listing all possible sundae combinations
  - Creating unique pizza orders with different topping choices
  - Planning vacation itineraries with different activity options each day
  - A photographer arranging family members in different photo positions
  - Designing custom sandwiches with bread, protein, and topping choices
  - Planning party games with different team arrangements
  - Creating secret codes using different symbol combinations
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid more than 3 categories or sets larger than 4 items
  - Don't use abstract symbols without concrete context
  - Avoid problems where order matters unless explicitly teaching arrangements
  - Don't present incomplete trees or tables without clear instructions
  - Avoid contexts unfamiliar to 9-10 year olds
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
