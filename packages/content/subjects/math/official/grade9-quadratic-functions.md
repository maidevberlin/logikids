name: Quadratic Functions
description: Study parabolas, their equations (vertex form, general form, factored form), parameter effects, graphing techniques, and key properties including range, zeros, and monotonicity.
grade: 9
focus: Quadratic functions and parabolas
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Describe how parameters a, d, and e affect the parabola y = a(x+d)² + e
  - Determine vertex coordinates and axis of symmetry using algebraic methods
  - Identify and analyze key properties including domain, range, zeros, and monotonicity
  - Convert between general form (ax² + bx + c), vertex form, and factored form
  - Graph parabolas accurately using transformations and key features
  - Apply quadratic functions to model and solve real-world problems
problem_types:
  - Parameter analysis
  - Vertex identification
  - Form conversion
  - Zero calculation
  - Graphing parabolas
  - Domain and range
  - Symmetry analysis
  - Monotonicity intervals
  - Real-world modeling
  - Property comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple parabolas with integer parameters (a = 1, small d and e values)
    - Vertex form with clear transformations from y = x²
    - Graphs with vertices on grid intersections
  medium:
    - Parabolas with fractional or negative parameters
    - Conversion between two different forms
    - Determining zeros and analyzing monotonicity intervals
  hard:
    - Complex conversions involving all three forms
    - Parameter optimization problems with constraints
    - Advanced applications requiring modeling and interpretation
prerequisites:
  - grade8-linear-functions
  - grade8-functions-basics
real_world_context:
  - Projectile motion and ballistics describe the path of thrown objects using parabolic trajectories
  - Architecture uses parabolic arches in bridges and buildings for optimal weight distribution
  - Physics models the relationship between braking distance and speed as a quadratic function
  - Economics applies quadratic functions to revenue, profit, and cost optimization problems
  - Engineering designs satellite dishes and headlights using parabolic reflectors for signal focusing
  - Suspension bridge cables forming parabolic curves under uniform load
  - Water fountain jets following parabolic paths due to gravity
  - Solar cookers using parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight
  - Skateboard half-pipes designed with parabolic cross-sections
  - Sound reflectors in amphitheaters using parabolic shapes for acoustics
  - Telescope mirrors ground to parabolic curves for light focusing
  - Basketball free-throw arcs optimized for scoring probability
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid confusing vertex form y = a(x-h)² + k with y = a(x+d)² + e notation
  - Don't mix up the effect of parameter a on opening width vs direction
  - Avoid problems where multiple forms are trivially equivalent without conversion
  - Don't ask for zeros when the discriminant is negative without clarification
  - Avoid real-world contexts ignoring physical constraints (negative values)
