# Written Multiplication and Division

Generate tasks that develop mastery of standard written algorithms for multiplication and division with multi-digit numbers. Tasks should emphasize procedural fluency, computational accuracy, estimation skills, and contextual understanding of operations.

## Problem Type Variations

Create diverse problem structures that test different aspects of written multiplication and division:

1. **Direct Multiplication Problems**: Multiply two multi-digit numbers using the standard algorithm, varying the number of digits in multiplicands and multipliers

2. **Division with Whole Number Quotients**: Divide multi-digit numbers by one-digit or two-digit divisors where the result is a whole number with no remainder

3. **Division with Remainders**: Perform division that results in remainders, requiring students to write answers in the form "quotient R remainder"

4. **Remainder Interpretation in Context**: Present word problems where the remainder must be interpreted differently based on context (round up, round down, use as fractional part, or state as separate remainder)

5. **Estimation and Verification**: Ask students to estimate products or quotients before calculating, then verify whether the exact answer is reasonable

6. **Missing Factor or Divisor Problems**: Provide the product and one factor (or quotient and one number), asking students to find the missing value using inverse operations

7. **Comparison Problems**: Compare products or quotients from different calculations to determine which is larger/smaller without necessarily computing exact values

8. **Multi-Step Word Problems**: Combine multiplication and division in realistic scenarios requiring multiple operations in sequence

9. **Error Analysis**: Present worked solutions with common algorithmic errors and ask students to identify and correct mistakes

10. **Place Value Reasoning**: Focus on understanding how place value works within the algorithms, such as explaining why certain digits are written in specific positions

## Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

### For {{age}} < 10 (Younger Students)
- Focus on multiplication with two-digit by one-digit numbers initially
- Division limited to three-digit dividends by one-digit divisors
- Provide step-by-step prompts or partially completed algorithm layouts
- Use concrete contexts with familiar objects and quantities
- Emphasize visual representations of the algorithm steps
- Simple remainder interpretation (just stating the remainder)

### For {{age}} >= 10 (Older Students)
- Extend to three-digit by two-digit multiplication
- Include division with two-digit divisors
- Expect complete algorithmic solutions without scaffolding
- Use more abstract or complex real-world contexts
- Require sophisticated remainder interpretation (contextual rounding decisions)
- Include estimation requirements as standard practice

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy ({{difficulty}} = "easy")
- Multiplication: two-digit by one-digit, or simple two-digit by two-digit with minimal carrying
- Division: three-digit by one-digit with quotients that have clear patterns
- Clear, straightforward word problems with explicit operation indicators
- Provide estimation benchmarks or reference points
- Remainders are clearly stated or zero

### Medium ({{difficulty}} = "medium")
- Multiplication: three-digit by two-digit numbers with multiple carrying steps
- Division: four-digit by two-digit divisors with varying quotient digits
- Word problems requiring students to determine which operation to use
- Estimation requires rounding to appropriate place values
- Remainders require contextual interpretation in word problems

### Hard ({{difficulty}} = "hard")
- Multiplication: large numbers (four-digit by three-digit) with complex carrying patterns
- Division: complex divisors requiring trial and error in quotient estimation
- Multi-step problems combining both operations with other arithmetic
- Verify reasonableness by working backwards or using inverse operations
- Error analysis requiring deep understanding of algorithm logic
- Remainders require sophisticated reasoning about fractional quantities or rounding decisions

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Vary numbers systematically to avoid predictable patterns:

- **Magnitude diversity**: Range from simple two-digit numbers to larger four or five-digit numbers depending on difficulty and age
- **Digit variety**: Include numbers with zeros in various positions, repeating digits, and diverse digit combinations
- **Carrying/borrowing complexity**: Some problems with minimal carrying, others with carrying in every position
- **Quotient patterns**: Division results that are simple single-digit quotients, multi-digit quotients, quotients with zeros in the middle
- **Remainder variety**: Remainders ranging from zero to one less than the divisor, avoiding predictable patterns
- **Contextual numbers**: When using real-world contexts, select quantities that are realistic for the situation (prices, measurements, quantities)
- **Estimation-friendly numbers**: Some tasks use numbers that round nicely for estimation, others require more complex rounding decisions

## Format and Representation Guidance

### When to Use Tables
- Presenting multiple calculations for comparison
- Organizing data in word problems involving rates, prices, or repeated quantities
- Showing step-by-step algorithm layouts for error analysis tasks

### When to Use Written Algorithm Layout
- Any task requiring students to show their work using standard algorithms
- Error analysis problems showing partially completed solutions
- Instructional tasks emphasizing procedural steps

### When to Use Word Problem Format
- Remainder interpretation tasks (context determines how to handle remainder)
- Real-world application problems
- Multi-step problems combining operations
- Tasks emphasizing mathematical reasoning over pure computation

### When to Use Estimation Format
- Tasks requiring students to estimate before calculating
- Verification tasks asking whether a given answer is reasonable
- Comparison tasks where exact values aren't needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do NOT create tasks that:
- Always use the same number of digits (vary between two, three, four-digit numbers)
- Feature numbers that follow obvious patterns (like all even, all multiples of 5, consecutive numbers)
- Use only context-free arithmetic without word problems or real-world connections
- Ignore remainder interpretation in division (always include varied approaches to remainders)
- Focus exclusively on computation without estimation or verification components
- Present multiplication and division as completely separate topics (integrate them appropriately)
- Use unrealistic numbers in word problems (prices should be reasonable, quantities should make sense)
- Repeat the same algorithmic structure across all tasks (vary which operations appear, where carrying occurs, etc.)

## Task Generation Principles

For each generated task:

1. **Select operation focus**: Decide whether to emphasize multiplication, division, or both
2. **Choose problem structure**: Pick from the 10 variation types based on learning objectives
3. **Determine numerical parameters**: Apply variation principles to select appropriate numbers
4. **Adapt for age**: Adjust complexity, scaffolding, and context based on {{age}}
5. **Scale for difficulty**: Apply appropriate difficulty indicators based on {{difficulty}} parameter
6. **Add context when beneficial**: Use word problems to make operations meaningful, but also include some pure computation tasks
7. **Include estimation or verification**: Especially for medium and hard difficulties, ask students to check reasonableness
8. **Vary remainder handling**: When division produces remainders, vary how students should express or interpret them

The goal is algorithmic fluency combined with number sense, estimation skills, and the ability to apply these operations flexibly in various contexts.
