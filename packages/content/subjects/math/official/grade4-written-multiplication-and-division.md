  - grade3-division-with-remainder
  - grade3-written-addition
  - grade3-written-subtraction
real_world_context: Calculating costs for multiple items, distributing quantities equally, planning purchases within budgets, solving measurement problems, understanding scales and proportions
problem_types:
  - Direct multiplication
  - Division whole quotients
  - Division with remainders
  - Remainder interpretation
  - Estimation verification
  - Missing factors
  - Comparison problems
  - Multi-step problems
  - Error analysis
  - Place value reasoning
age_guidelines:
  10:
    - Focus on multiplication with two-digit by one-digit numbers initially
    - Division limited to three-digit dividends by one-digit divisors
    - Provide step-by-step prompts or partially completed algorithm layouts
    - Use concrete contexts with familiar objects and quantities
    - Emphasize visual representations of the algorithm steps
    - Simple remainder interpretation (just stating the remainder)
    - Extend to three-digit by two-digit multiplication
    - Include division with two-digit divisors
    - Expect complete algorithmic solutions without scaffolding
    - Use more abstract or complex real-world contexts
    - Require sophisticated remainder interpretation (contextual rounding decisions)
    - Include estimation requirements as standard practice
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - "Multiplication: two-digit by one-digit, or simple two-digit by two-digit with minimal carrying"
    - "Division: three-digit by one-digit with quotients that have clear patterns"
    - Clear, straightforward word problems with explicit operation indicators
    - Provide estimation benchmarks or reference points
    - Remainders are clearly stated or zero
  medium:
    - "Multiplication: three-digit by two-digit numbers with multiple carrying steps"
    - "Division: four-digit by two-digit divisors with varying quotient digits"
    - Word problems requiring students to determine which operation to use
    - Estimation requires rounding to appropriate place values
    - Remainders require contextual interpretation in word problems
  hard:
    - "Multiplication: large numbers (four-digit by three-digit) with complex carrying patterns"
    - "Division: complex divisors requiring trial and error in quotient estimation"
    - Multi-step problems combining both operations with other arithmetic
    - Verify reasonableness by working backwards or using inverse operations
    - Error analysis requiring deep understanding of algorithm logic
    - Remainders require sophisticated reasoning about fractional quantities or rounding decisions
