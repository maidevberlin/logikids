  - Setting up terms
  - Simplifying complex terms
  - Word problem translation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple terms with one or two variables (e.g., 3x + 5)
    - Evaluating terms with single-digit substitutions
    - Combining like terms with coefficients up to 20
  medium:
    - Terms with multiple variables and powers up to exponent 3

    - Applying binomial formulas (a+b)², (a-b)², (a+b)(a-b)
    - Multi-step simplification requiring multiple operations
    - Complex word problems requiring term setup and transformation
prerequisites:
  - grade6-combined-operations
  - grade5-negative-numbers
real_world_context:
  - Calculating costs where some values are fixed and others vary with quantity (e.g., 5 + 2n for entry fee plus per-person cost)
  - Describing geometric patterns where side lengths or areas depend on a variable dimension
  - Expressing formulas for area and perimeter of rectangles with variable side lengths
  - Calculating distances in uniform motion where time or speed varies
  - Simplifying expressions in physics formulas such as force, energy, or power calculations
  - A baker calculating ingredient amounts when scaling recipes by a variable multiplier
  - Video game designers creating damage formulas that depend on character level and equipment
  - Musicians calculating tempo changes using algebraic expressions for beats per minute
  - Athletes tracking training progress with formulas combining distance, time, and heart rate
  - Event planners estimating costs for variable numbers of guests and fixed venue fees
  - Gardeners calculating fertilizer amounts based on garden area expressed algebraically
  - Phone plan comparisons using terms for base cost plus per-gigabyte data charges
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid terms with more than 3 different variables
  - Don't use exponents larger than 4 or negative exponents
  - Avoid fractions with variables in the denominator
  - Don't combine unrelated operations in one problem
  - Avoid context scenarios unfamiliar to 13-year-olds
