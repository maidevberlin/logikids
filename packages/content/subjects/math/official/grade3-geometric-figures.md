# Geometric Figures

Generate tasks that help students explore properties of rectangles and squares, understand right angles, and calculate perimeters.

## Task Variations

### 1. Identifying Rectangles and Squares
Recognize and distinguish these shapes:
- Show various quadrilaterals and ask students to identify rectangles and squares
- "Which of these shapes are rectangles? Which are squares?"
- Explain: "A square is a special rectangle where all sides are equal"
- Use SVG diagrams:

<svg width="400" height="150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Rectangle -->
  <rect x="20" y="40" width="80" height="50" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="45" y="100" font-size="14">A</text>

  <!-- Square -->
  <rect x="130" y="40" width="60" height="60" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="150" y="115" font-size="14">B</text>

  <!-- Parallelogram -->
  <path d="M 220 40 L 280 40 L 300 90 L 240 90 Z" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="255" y="110" font-size="14">C</text>

  <!-- Trapezoid -->
  <path d="M 330 50 L 380 50 L 390 90 L 320 90 Z" fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="350" y="110" font-size="14">D</text>
</svg>

### 2. Properties of Rectangles
Understand rectangle characteristics:
- "A rectangle has 4 sides and 4 right angles. Opposite sides are equal."
- Present rectangles with labeled sides: "If side $a = {{length}}$ cm and side $b = {{width}}$ cm, what are the lengths of all four sides?"
- Create property questions:
  - "How many right angles does a rectangle have?"
  - "If one side is 7 cm, what is the opposite side?"
- Use measurement contexts: "A book is 24 cm long and 18 cm wide. What shape is it?"

### 3. Properties of Squares
Explore special characteristics of squares:
- "A square is a rectangle where all four sides are equal"
- "A square has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles"
- Given one side length, find all sides: "If one side of a square is {{length}} cm, how long are the other three sides?"
- Compare: "How is a square different from a rectangle? How are they similar?"

### 4. Right Angles
Identify and understand 90-degree angles:
- "Mark all the right angles in this rectangle"
- "Which corners of this shape have right angles?"
- Real-world examples: "Where do you see right angles in your classroom?"
- Show angles and ask which are right angles:

<svg width="300" height="120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Right angle -->
  <line x1="20" y1="80" x2="80" y2="80" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <line x1="80" y1="80" x2="80" y2="20" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="70" y="70" width="10" height="10" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="1"/>
  <text x="40" y="110" font-size="14">A (90°)</text>

  <!-- Acute angle -->
  <line x1="120" y1="80" x2="180" y2="80" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <line x1="180" y1="80" x2="160" y2="30" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="140" y="110" font-size="14">B (60°)</text>

  <!-- Obtuse angle -->
  <line x1="220" y1="80" x2="280" y2="80" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <line x1="220" y1="80" x2="260" y2="30" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="235" y="110" font-size="14">C (120°)</text>
</svg>

### 5. Perimeter of Rectangles
Calculate the distance around rectangles:
- Formula: Perimeter $= 2a + 2b$ or $2(a + b)$
- "A rectangle has length $a = {{length}}$ cm and width $b = {{width}}$ cm. What is the perimeter?"
- Vary the numbers: use lengths 3-15 cm, widths 2-10 cm
- Word problems: "A garden is 8 m long and 5 m wide. How much fencing is needed?"
- Show step-by-step: $P = 2 \times 8 + 2 \times 5 = 16 + 10 = 26$ m

### 6. Perimeter of Squares
Calculate perimeter with equal sides:
- Formula: Perimeter $= 4s$ where $s$ is the side length
- "A square has sides of {{length}} cm. What is the perimeter?"
- Compare to rectangles: "Why is the square formula simpler?"
- Create tables:

| Side Length $(s)$ | Perimeter $(4s)$ |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 3 cm              | 12 cm            |
| 5 cm              | 20 cm            |
| 7 cm              | ?                |
| 9 cm              | ?                |

### 7. Finding Missing Dimensions
Work backwards from perimeter:
- "A rectangle has perimeter 24 cm. One side is 7 cm. What is the other side?"
- Show reasoning: If $P = 2a + 2b$ and $P = 24$, $a = 7$, then $2(7) + 2b = 24$
- "A square has perimeter 32 cm. How long is each side?"
- Use division: $P = 4s$, so $s = P \div 4 = 32 \div 4 = 8$ cm

### 8. Drawing and Measuring Activities
Practical construction tasks:
- "Draw a rectangle with length {{length}} cm and width {{width}} cm using a ruler and set square"
- "Measure this rectangle and calculate its perimeter"
- "Draw a square with perimeter 20 cm. How long is each side?"
- Grid-based drawing: "On graph paper, draw a rectangle that is 6 squares long and 4 squares wide"

### 9. Comparing Shapes
Analyze multiple figures:
- Present two rectangles with different dimensions: "Which has the larger perimeter?"
  - Rectangle A: $6 \times 4$ cm
  - Rectangle B: $8 \times 3$ cm
- "Can two rectangles with different shapes have the same perimeter?"
- Challenge: "Draw three different rectangles, each with perimeter 24 cm"

### 10. Real-World Applications
Apply concepts to practical scenarios:
- "A picture frame is 30 cm long and 20 cm wide. How much frame material is needed?"
- "A rectangular playground is 45 m by 30 m. How far do you walk if you go around it once?"
- "A square table has sides of 80 cm. What is its perimeter in meters?"
- Include unit conversions: cm to m, m to cm

## Difficulty Scaling

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy):**
- Identify rectangles and squares
- Count right angles
- Simple perimeter with small numbers
- Squares with sides 2-8 cm
- Example: "Square with side 5 cm, perimeter = ?"

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium):**
- Calculate rectangle perimeters with two different sides
- Properties and comparisons
- Simple missing dimension problems
- Dimensions 5-15 cm
- Example: "Rectangle $a = 9$ cm, $b = 6$ cm, $P = ?$"

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard):**
- Find missing dimensions from perimeter
- Compare multiple shapes
- Multi-step word problems
- Unit conversions
- Drawing tasks with specifications
- Example: "Rectangle perimeter 34 cm, one side 8 cm. Find other side and draw the rectangle."
