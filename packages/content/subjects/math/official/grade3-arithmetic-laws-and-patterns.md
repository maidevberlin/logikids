focus: Basic arithmetic operations and pattern recognition
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and apply the commutative law in addition and multiplication
  - Recognize and apply the associative law in addition and multiplication
  - Understand and use the distributive law for simple calculations
  - Identify pattern rules in arithmetic and geometric sequences

prerequisites:
  - grade2-addition-and-subtraction-up-to-100
  - grade2-introduction-to-multiplication
  - grade2-number-sequences-and-patterns
real_world_context: Arithmetic laws and pattern recognition are fundamental for mental math strategies, efficient problem-solving, and understanding relationships between numbers in everyday situations like calculating prices, measuring distances, and organizing collections
problem_types:
  - Law recognition
  - Missing numbers
  - Strategy selection
  - Pattern continuation
  - Pattern creation
  - Error analysis
  - Real-world patterns
  - Law comparison
  - Bracket placement
  - Pattern discovery
age_guidelines:
  8:
    - Focus on recognizing that swapping numbers in addition and multiplication gives the same result
    - Use concrete numbers and simple patterns with clear, single-step rules
    - Emphasize visual representations and physical manipulatives
    - Keep sequences short with obvious patterns
    - Use familiar contexts like arranging toys, counting objects, or simple repeating designs
  9:
    - Introduce formal names for the laws and use mathematical vocabulary
    - Work with larger numbers and multi-step patterns
    - Include more complex arithmetic and geometric sequences
    - Challenge students to find multiple patterns in the same sequence
    - Use abstract notation and encourage algebraic thinking
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single arithmetic law per problem
    - Clear, obvious patterns with consistent rules
    - Small numbers within familiar number ranges
    - Direct application without multiple steps
    - Visual support with pattern representations
  medium:
    - Combining two arithmetic laws in one problem
    - Patterns with slightly less obvious rules requiring closer examination
    - Moderate number ranges with some mental calculation required
    - Choosing between different strategies or approaches
    - Mix of arithmetic and geometric patterns
  hard:
    - Problems requiring all three arithmetic laws
    - Complex patterns with combined rules or alternating operations
    - Larger numbers requiring strategic use of laws for efficient calculation
    - Creating patterns with multiple constraints
    - Analyzing why certain laws don't apply in specific situations

version_notes: Initial migration to frontmatter-based format. Extracted problem types from prose structure variations, consolidated age scaffolding into age_guidelines, and organized difficulty scaling into difficulty_guidelines arrays.
