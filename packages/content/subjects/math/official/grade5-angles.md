id: grade5-angles
name: Angles and Measurement
description: Understanding angle types, measuring angles with a protractor, estimating angles, and recognizing angle relationships
grade: 5
focus: Angle classification and measurement
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify acute, right, obtuse, and straight angles
  - Measure angles using a protractor accurately
  - Estimate angle sizes before measuring
  - Draw angles of given measurements
  - Understand reflex angles and full rotation
  - Recognize complementary and supplementary relationships
problem_types:
  - Angle classification
  - Protractor reading
  - Angle measurement
  - Angle drawing
  - Estimation practice
  - Complementary/supplementary
  - Angle comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Right angles and simple acute/obtuse angles
    - Angles that are multiples of 10 degrees
    - Direct protractor reading with clear markings
  medium:
    - Precise angle measurements to the nearest degree
    - Estimation within 10 degrees of actual measurement
    - Identifying complementary angles (sum to 90 degrees)
  hard:
    - Reflex angles (greater than 180 degrees)
    - Supplementary angle calculations (sum to 180 degrees)
    - Multiple angle relationships in complex figures
prerequisites:
  - grade4-geometry-spatial
real_world_context:
  - Clock hands showing different times and the angles they form
  - Ramps and slides at different steepness levels
  - Opening doors and lids to various positions
  - Turns and directions in navigation and map reading
  - Sports angles like skateboard ramps or golf club positions
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid angle calculations requiring algebraic equations
  - Don't include trigonometry concepts (sine, cosine, tangent)
  - Avoid angles in polygons (separate topic for later grades)
  - Don't use negative angle measures
  - Avoid contexts requiring precise technical drawing tools beyond protractor
