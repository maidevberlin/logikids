name: Units and Measurement
description: Advanced metric unit conversions, calculations with mixed units, and choosing appropriate measurement units for different contexts
grade: 5
focus: Metric system mastery and measurement applications
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Convert between metric length units (mm, cm, m, km) with multi-step conversions
  - Convert between metric mass units (g, kg, t) including decimal notation
  - Convert between metric capacity units (mL, L) in various contexts
  - Perform calculations with measurements in mixed units
  - Choose appropriate units for given measurement contexts
  - Estimate measurements in real-world situations accurately
problem_types:
  - Unit conversion
  - Measurement calculations
  - Unit selection
  - Estimation practice
  - Comparison problems
  - Word problems
  - Multi-step conversions
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single conversions within same measurement type (500 cm = 5 m)
    - Simple operations with same units (2.5 kg + 1.3 kg)
    - Direct unit selection for common objects
  medium:
    - Conversions requiring decimal understanding (0.75 km = 750 m)
    - Operations with different units requiring conversion first
    - Two-step conversion problems (km to cm)
  hard:
    - Multi-step calculations with mixed units and conversions
    - Complex word problems requiring unit analysis
    - Comparison of measurements across different unit systems
prerequisites:
  - grade4-measurement-units
  - grade4-money-decimals
real_world_context:
  - Planning travel distances using maps with different scale units (km on highways, m in cities)
  - Measuring ingredients for cooking and scaling recipes with metric measurements
  - Understanding body measurements and health metrics (height in cm or m, weight in kg)
  - Calculating shipping weights and costs for packages using kg and g
  - Comparing product quantities at stores (1.5 L bottle vs 500 mL cans)
  - A veterinarian weighing pets and calculating medicine doses
  - Athletes tracking running distances in kilometers and meters
  - Buying fabric by the meter for sewing projects
  - Filling water bottles and tracking daily water intake in liters
  - A scientist measuring liquid volumes in milliliters for experiments
  - Comparing luggage weight limits for different airlines
  - Measuring room dimensions for new furniture purchases
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid imperial or customary units (miles, pounds, gallons, inches)
  - Don't mix mass and weight terminology confusingly
  - Avoid time unit conversions (separate concept)
  - Don't use metric prefixes beyond milli- and kilo- (no micro-, mega-, etc.)
  - Avoid area or volume units (m², cm³) in conversion problems
