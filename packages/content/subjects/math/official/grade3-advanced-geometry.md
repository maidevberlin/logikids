name: Advanced Geometry
description: >-
  Exploring pyramids, cones, and cylinders; understanding nets of 3D shapes;
  deepened symmetry work
grade: 3
focus: Advanced three-dimensional geometry and symmetry
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and name advanced 3D shapes (pyramid, cone, cylinder)
  - Understand and visualize nets of 3D shapes (cube, cuboid, pyramid)
  - Recognize which nets can fold into specific 3D shapes
  - Identify multiple lines of symmetry in 2D shapes
  - Create symmetric figures and patterns using reflection
  - Analyze and compare properties of 3D shapes (edges, faces, vertices)
  - Apply symmetry concepts to solve geometric problems
problem_types:
  - Shape identification
  - Net matching
  - Net folding visualization
  - Symmetry line finding
  - Symmetric completion
  - Face and edge counting
  - Shape property comparison
  - Symmetry pattern creation
  - 3D to 2D net conversion
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify clear 3D shapes from standard orientations
    - Match simple nets to basic shapes (cube, simple pyramid)
    - Find 1-2 obvious lines of symmetry in regular shapes
  medium:
    - Work with all advanced shapes (pyramid, cone, cylinder)
    - Identify which of 2-3 nets fold into a given shape
    - Find all lines of symmetry in regular polygons (up to hexagon)
  hard:
    - Analyze complex nets with rotated or non-standard layouts
    - Complete partially drawn symmetric figures with multiple symmetry lines
    - Count faces, edges, vertices on composite or complex shapes
prerequisites:
  - grade1-solid-shapes
  - grade1-plane-shapes
real_world_context:
  - Recognizing pyramid shapes in buildings like Egyptian pyramids or roof structures
  - Identifying cone shapes in ice cream cones, traffic cones, and party hats
  - Finding cylinder shapes in cans, pipes, and rolled paper
  - Unfolding cardboard boxes to see their nets and understanding packaging
  - Observing symmetry in nature like butterfly wings, leaves, and flowers
  - A gift wrapper cutting and folding paper into box shapes
  - Spotting tent shapes at a campground as pyramid examples
  - Finding symmetry in traditional tile patterns and mosaics
  - Recognizing megaphone and funnel shapes as cones
  - An artist designing symmetric mandala patterns
  - Identifying cylinder shapes in lighthouse towers and silos
  - Exploring nets when constructing paper craft models
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid technical formulas for volume or surface area
  - Don't use shapes beyond pyramid, cone, cylinder for grade 3
  - Avoid nets with more than 8 faces - keep it developmentally appropriate
  - Don't ask about angle measurements or precise geometric calculations
  - Avoid irregular pyramids - use square-based pyramids only
