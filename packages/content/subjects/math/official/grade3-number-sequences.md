# Number Sequences

Generate tasks that help students recognize, describe, continue, and find errors in increasingly complex number patterns.

## Task Variations

### 1. Continuing Simple Patterns
Extend sequences with clear, regular patterns:
- **Addition Patterns**: "{{start}}, {{n2}}, {{n3}}, ___, ___, ___" (adding {{step}})
- **Subtraction Patterns**: "{{start}}, {{n2}}, {{n3}}, ___, ___, ___" (subtracting {{step}})
- **Skip Counting**: "Count by {{skip}} from {{start}}: ___, ___, ___, ___"

Examples:
- Add 7: $8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43$ (rule: $+7$)
- Subtract 12: $96, 84, 72, 60, 48$ (rule: $-12$)
- Count by 25: $25, 50, 75, 100, 125$ (rule: $+25$)

### 2. Multiplication and Division Patterns
Work with multiplicative patterns:
- **Doubling**: "{{start}}, ___, ___, ___ (each number doubles)"
- **Halving**: "{{start}}, ___, ___, ___ (each number is halved)"
- **Multiply by N**: "Pattern multiplies by {{factor}}: {{start}}, ___, ___, ___"

Examples:
- Double: $3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96$ (rule: $\times 2$)
- Triple: $2, 6, 18, 54, 162$ (rule: $\times 3$)
- Halve: $128, 64, 32, 16, 8$ (rule: $\div 2$)

### 3. Two-Step Patterns
Patterns with alternating rules:
- **Alternating Operations**: "{{start}}, ___, ___, ___ (rule alternates: {{op1}}, then {{op2}})"
- **Growing Steps**: "{{start}}, ___, ___ (add {{step1}}, then add {{step2}}, then add {{step3}}...)"

Examples:
- Alternate +10, -5: $20, 30, 25, 35, 30, 40$
- Growing additions: $5, 6, 8, 11, 15, 20$ (add 1, add 2, add 3, add 4, add 5)
- $2, 5, 10, 17, 26$ (add 3, add 5, add 7, add 9 - odd numbers)

### 4. Describing Pattern Rules
State the rule in words:
- **What's the Rule?**: "Look at this sequence: {{sequence}}. Describe the pattern rule"
- **Multiple Ways**: "Find two different ways to describe this pattern: {{sequence}}"
- **In Your Words**: "Explain how to get from one number to the next"

Examples:
- $12, 24, 36, 48$ → "Add 12 each time" or "Multiples of 12"
- $100, 90, 80, 70$ → "Subtract 10 each time" or "Count down by tens"
- $1, 4, 7, 10$ → "Add 3 each time" or "Start at 1, keep adding 3"

### 5. Finding Missing Numbers
Fill gaps in sequences:
- **Single Gap**: "{{n1}}, {{n2}}, ___, {{n4}}, {{n5}}"
- **Multiple Gaps**: "{{n1}}, ___, {{n3}}, ___, {{n5}}"
- **Beginning or End**: "___, ___, {{n3}}, {{n4}}, {{n5}}" or "{{n1}}, {{n2}}, {{n3}}, ___, ___"

Examples:
- $7, 14, \_\_\_, 28, 35$ → missing: 21 (rule: $+7$)
- $\_\_\_, 40, 32, 24, 16$ → missing: 48 (rule: $-8$)
- $5, \_\_\_, 20, \_\_\_, 80$ → missing: 10, 40 (rule: $\times 2$)

### 6. Finding Errors in Sequences
Identify mistakes in patterns:
- **Spot the Error**: "This sequence has one mistake. Find it: {{sequence_with_error}}"
- **Explain Why**: "The number {{wrong_number}} doesn't fit. Why not? What should it be?"
- **Multiple Errors**: "This pattern has {{num}} errors. Find and fix them"

Examples:
- $6, 12, 18, 25, 30$ → Error: 25 should be 24 (rule: $+6$)
- $80, 70, 60, 40, 30, 20$ → Error: missing 50 (rule: $-10$)
- $3, 9, 27, 71, 243$ → Error: 71 should be 81 (rule: $\times 3$)

### 7. Creating Your Own Patterns
Design sequences with specific rules:
- **Follow Rule**: "Create a sequence starting at {{start}} using the rule: {{rule}}"
- **Make a Pattern**: "Invent a number pattern that uses {{operation}}. Write 6 numbers"
- **Pattern Challenge**: "Make the hardest pattern you can and describe its rule"

Examples:
- Start at 5, add 8 each time → $5, 13, 21, 29, 37, 45$
- Start at 200, subtract 15 → $200, 185, 170, 155, 140, 125$

### 8. Real-World Pattern Problems
Apply patterns to realistic contexts:
- **Money**: "You save {{start}} cents. Each week you save {{increase}} more. How much after {{weeks}} weeks?"
- **Growth**: "Plant is {{start}} cm tall. It grows {{rate}} cm each week. Height after {{time}} weeks?"
- **Schedules**: "Bus comes at {{time1}}, {{time2}}, {{time3}}. What pattern? When will next {{num}} buses arrive?"

Examples:
- Save 10¢, add 5¢ more each week: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 (Week 5: 30¢)
- Plant 8 cm, grows 3 cm/week: 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 (Week 4: 20 cm)
- Bus times: 8:00, 8:15, 8:30, 8:45 (next: 9:00, 9:15, 9:30)

## Answer Requirements

Provide solutions that:
- Clearly state the pattern rule in words
- Show the operation between consecutive terms
- Use variables or formulas for complex patterns (e.g., "add increasing multiples of 2")
- Include both the missing numbers AND the reasoning
- For errors, explain what's wrong and what the correct value should be
- Use tables to organize longer sequences:

| Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Number   | 5 | 10| 15| 20| 25|
| Rule     | start | +5 | +5 | +5 | +5 |
