# Task Generation Guidelines for Divisibility and Prime Numbers (Grade 5)

Generate tasks that help students understand and apply divisibility rules, distinguish between prime and composite numbers, work with prime factorization, and find greatest common divisors and least common multiples.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse task types that test different aspects of number theory understanding:

1. **Divisibility Rule Application**: Present one or more numbers and ask students to determine divisibility by specific values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 10) using the appropriate rule. Vary whether you ask for yes/no determination, which numbers are divisible, or which divisibility rules apply to a given number.

2. **Prime vs. Composite Classification**: Provide numbers and ask students to identify which are prime, which are composite, or explain why a number belongs to one category. Include edge cases like 1 (neither prime nor composite) and 2 (the only even prime).

3. **Prime Number Generation**: Ask students to list all prime numbers within a given range, identify the next prime after a specific number, or find primes satisfying certain conditions (e.g., between two values, with specific digit properties).

4. **Prime Factorization**: Present composite numbers and ask students to find the complete prime factorization, either as a product of primes or in exponential notation. Vary the size and complexity of the numbers based on difficulty.

5. **Greatest Common Divisor (ggT)**: Provide two or more numbers and ask students to find their ggT through listing factors, prime factorization method, or recognition of patterns. Include real-world scenarios requiring finding common factors.

6. **Least Common Multiple (kgV)**: Present two or more numbers and ask for their kgV using various methods - listing multiples, prime factorization, or pattern recognition. Connect to real-world problems about coordinating cycles or schedules.

7. **Pattern Recognition in Divisibility**: Show number sequences and ask students to identify patterns related to divisibility (e.g., every third number is divisible by 3, alternating even/odd patterns, or arithmetic sequences with specific divisibility properties).

8. **Factor Analysis**: Ask students to find all factors of a number, determine the number of factors, identify factor pairs, or compare factor sets of different numbers. Include questions about what factor count reveals about prime vs. composite status.

9. **Divisibility Rule Justification**: Present divisibility rules and ask students to apply them to specific numbers while explaining their reasoning. Or provide numbers and ask which rule(s) can be used to determine divisibility without performing division.

10. **Combined Challenges**: Create multi-step problems that combine concepts - for example, finding primes within a range that satisfy divisibility conditions, determining ggT and kgV of the same number set, or using factorization to simplify complex divisibility questions.

## Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

### Younger Students ({{age}} = 10)
- Focus on smaller numbers (up to 100 for most tasks)
- Emphasize simpler divisibility rules (2, 5, 10 first, then 3 and 9)
- Use visual aids like factor trees or number grids
- Limit prime number range to approximately 2-50
- ggT and kgV tasks with small numbers (single-digit to low double-digit)
- Provide step-by-step guidance in problem structure
- Use concrete contexts (arranging objects, forming groups)
- Questions may offer multiple-choice support

### Older Students ({{age}} = 11)
- Extend to larger numbers (up to 1000 for some tasks)
- Include all divisibility rules (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10)
- Reduce scaffolding, expect more independent reasoning
- Work with primes up to approximately 100
- ggT and kgV with larger numbers or multiple values (3+ numbers)
- Combine multiple concepts in single problems
- More abstract reasoning without concrete contexts
- Open-response questions requiring written explanations

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy
- Single-step divisibility checks with obvious rules (2, 5, 10)
- Small numbers (under 50) for prime identification
- Factor finding for numbers with few factors
- Prime factorization of simple composites (products of 2-3 small primes)
- ggT and kgV of number pairs with obvious relationships
- Visual support like factor trees or number charts provided
- Clear, direct questions with minimal ambiguity

### Medium
- Multi-step problems combining divisibility rules
- Numbers 50-200 for prime identification and factorization
- Divisibility rules requiring more calculation (3, 6, 9)
- ggT and kgV requiring systematic method (listing or factorization)
- Pattern recognition in sequences
- Problems requiring explanation or justification
- Mix of abstract and contextual scenarios

### Hard
- Complex multi-step problems integrating multiple concepts
- Large numbers (200-1000) requiring efficient strategies
- All divisibility rules including compound rules (6 requires both 2 and 3)
- ggT and kgV of three or more numbers
- Prime factorization with larger composites or numbers with many factors
- Problems requiring proof or counterexample reasoning
- Abstract mathematical reasoning without scaffolding
- Creating examples meeting specific criteria

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

**Number Range**: Systematically vary between small (under 20), medium (20-100), and large (100-1000) numbers. Don't repeatedly use the same number set. Include both "nice" numbers and more challenging ones.

**Prime Distribution**: Rotate through small primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13), medium primes (17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47), and occasional larger primes (53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97). Vary which primes appear in factorizations.

**Composite Variety**: Include products of two primes (semiprimes), products of repeated primes (perfect powers like 8, 27, 64), and products of multiple distinct primes. Vary factor complexity.

**Special Numbers**: Occasionally include numbers with interesting properties - perfect squares, numbers with many factors (like 12, 24, 36), highly composite numbers, or numbers close to powers of 10.

**ggT/kgV Relationships**: Vary whether number pairs are coprime (ggT = 1), multiples of each other (ggT equals smaller number), or have intermediate relationships. Include cases where kgV is much larger or closer to the product.

## Contextual and Abstract Balance

**Real-World Contexts**:
- Arranging items into equal rows or groups (divisibility)
- Packaging and distribution problems (factors and multiples)
- Scheduling recurring events that align (kgV applications)
- Sharing resources fairly among groups (ggT applications)
- Tile patterns and arrays requiring equal divisions
- Time-based cycles (traffic lights, buses, rotating schedules)

**Abstract Mathematical Tasks**:
- Pure number theory problems without context
- Pattern exploration in number sequences
- Proof-style reasoning (why certain numbers can't be prime)
- Comparative analysis of number properties
- Rule application and justification

Balance between concrete and abstract based on age and difficulty - more context for younger/easier, more abstraction for older/harder.

## Divisibility Rules Reference

Ensure tasks reflect these standard rules correctly:

- **Divisible by 2**: Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- **Divisible by 3**: Sum of digits is divisible by 3
- **Divisible by 4**: Last two digits form a number divisible by 4
- **Divisible by 5**: Last digit is 0 or 5
- **Divisible by 6**: Divisible by both 2 and 3
- **Divisible by 9**: Sum of digits is divisible by 9
- **Divisible by 10**: Last digit is 0

## Format and Presentation Guidance

**When to Use Visual Elements**:
- Factor trees for prime factorization (especially for {{age}} = 10 or {{difficulty}} = easy)
- Number grids or charts showing multiples/factors
- Venn diagrams for ggT/kgV concepts
- Number lines for prime distribution visualization

**When to Use Tables**:
- Comparing divisibility of multiple numbers across different divisors
- Organizing factors or multiples systematically
- Showing prime factorizations of related numbers
- Displaying ggT/kgV calculations step-by-step

**LaTeX/Mathematical Notation**:
- Use proper mathematical symbols for multiplication (×) and exponents
- Prime factorization in standard form: 60 = 2² × 3 × 5
- Clear notation for ggT and kgV (or GCD/LCM if using English terms)
- Use division notation appropriately when showing divisibility

**Language Considerations**:
- Define technical terms clearly: prime (Primzahl), composite (zusammengesetzte Zahl), factor (Teiler), multiple (Vielfaches)
- Use precise mathematical language: "divisible by" rather than "goes into"
- Introduce ggT (größter gemeinsamer Teiler) and kgV (kleinstes gemeinsames Vielfaches) with clear explanations
- Avoid confusing terminology about "prime factorization" vs. just "factors"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**DO NOT**:
- Confuse factors with multiples (factors divide into a number, multiples are products of a number)
- State that 1 is prime (it's neither prime nor composite by definition)
- Overlook that 2 is the only even prime number
- Use division algorithms when divisibility rules suffice
- Present ggT/kgV without clarifying which is being requested
- Assume students remember all divisibility rules without scaffolding
- Mix up "divisor" (Teiler) and "dividend" (Dividend) terminology
- Create impossible scenarios (e.g., ggT larger than the smallest number)

**Ensure Variety By**:
- Rotating through all problem types listed above
- Alternating between rule application, classification, and calculation tasks
- Varying number sizes and complexity systematically
- Balancing contextual and abstract problems
- Including both recognition and generation tasks
- Varying between single-number and multiple-number problems
- Using different divisibility rules across task sets

## Connection to Curriculum Standards

This concept aligns with the KMK Bildungsstandards for Mathematics, specifically within Leitidee L1 (Zahl - Numbers) and Leitidee L3 (Muster und Strukturen - Patterns and Structures). Students develop number theory understanding that connects arithmetic with algebraic thinking. They learn to recognize patterns, apply systematic methods, and understand the structural properties of numbers. This foundation is essential for later work with fractions, algebraic expressions, and mathematical reasoning.
