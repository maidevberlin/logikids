# Data Analysis and Statistics

Create tasks that help students develop skills in analyzing, interpreting, and comparing data, calculating statistical measures, and understanding probability concepts appropriate for grade 4 level.

## Problem Structure Variations

Generate diverse problem types to test different aspects of data analysis and statistical thinking:

1. **Diagram Interpretation**: Present a complex diagram (bar chart, pictograph, line plot, or table) and ask students to extract specific information, identify patterns, or answer comparison questions
2. **Mean Calculation**: Provide a dataset and guide students through calculating the arithmetic mean, either with scaffolding (sum given) or requiring complete calculation
3. **Dataset Comparison**: Present two or more related datasets (e.g., different weeks, different groups) and ask students to compare measures, identify differences, or make conclusions
4. **Probability Expression**: Describe a simple random experiment and ask students to express the probability of specific outcomes as fractions
5. **Theoretical vs. Experimental**: Present data from repeated experiments and ask students to compare observed results with theoretical probability
6. **Data Collection Planning**: Ask students to design a simple data collection method for a given question and predict what kind of diagram would best represent the results
7. **Missing Data Problems**: Provide a partially complete dataset with the mean given, asking students to find missing values
8. **Real-world Analysis**: Present authentic data from everyday situations (temperature over a week, goals scored, survey results) and ask interpretive questions
9. **Probability Scenarios**: Describe situations involving chance (coin flips, dice rolls, spinner outcomes, drawing from containers) and ask about likelihood using appropriate terminology
10. **Error Detection**: Show a diagram or calculation with intentional errors and ask students to identify and correct them

## Age-Based Scaffolding

Adjust complexity and support based on age:

### Younger Students ({{age}} = 9)
- Provide more structured guidance with step-by-step prompts
- Use smaller datasets (typically 4-8 data points)
- Include visual diagrams already created rather than requiring interpretation from raw data
- Focus on whole numbers and simple fractions for probability (halves, quarters)
- Use familiar, concrete contexts (classroom activities, favorite colors, pets)
- Provide vocabulary support for terms like "mean," "average," "certain," "impossible," "probable"
- Break complex tasks into multiple smaller questions

### Older Students ({{age}} = 10)
- Present more open-ended questions requiring independent reasoning
- Use larger datasets (up to 12-15 data points)
- Mix diagram interpretation with data table reading
- Include probability scenarios with more outcomes (sixths, eighths, tenths)
- Use more varied contexts including abstract or less familiar situations
- Expect students to explain their reasoning and justify conclusions
- Combine multiple skills in single problems (e.g., calculate mean AND compare datasets)

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy)
- Datasets with 4-6 values, mostly whole numbers below 20
- Direct reading from clearly labeled diagrams
- Mean calculation with helpful structure (sum provided or very small numbers)
- Probability with 2-4 equally likely outcomes
- Single-step questions with clear wording
- Familiar everyday contexts
- Comparison questions with obvious differences

### Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium)
- Datasets with 6-10 values, whole numbers up to 100
- Diagrams requiring careful interpretation or combining information from multiple parts
- Mean calculation requiring both addition and division
- Probability with 4-8 outcomes, some requiring simplification of fractions
- Two-step problems requiring intermediate calculation or reasoning
- Mix of familiar and somewhat novel contexts
- Comparison requiring numerical calculation or closer analysis

### Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard)
- Datasets with 8-15 values, numbers over 100 or including decimals (one decimal place)
- Complex diagrams with multiple data series or requiring inference
- Mean calculation with strategic thinking (finding missing values, working backwards from mean)
- Probability scenarios with 8+ outcomes or compound events (two-step experiments)
- Multi-step problems requiring planning and strategic approach
- Abstract or unfamiliar contexts requiring transfer of knowledge
- Comparison and analysis requiring sophisticated reasoning about relationships between measures

## Diagram Types and Representation

Guide the AI to use appropriate visual representations:

- **Bar charts**: Vertical or horizontal bars showing frequencies or measurements, clearly labeled axes
- **Pictographs**: Symbol-based representations where each symbol represents a quantity (specify the scale)
- **Line plots**: Number lines with marks above values showing frequency
- **Tables**: Organized data in rows and columns with clear headers
- **Tally charts**: Traditional tallying with groups of five for frequency counting

Describe which type suits the data and question, but do not provide actual diagram code. For visual tasks, indicate that the diagram should clearly show all necessary information with appropriate labels.

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Ensure variety in the numbers used across different tasks:

- **Scale diversity**: Include small numbers (single digits), medium numbers (10-50), and larger numbers (50-200) depending on difficulty
- **Calculation friendliness**: For easier problems, choose numbers that divide evenly; for harder problems, include remainders or require rounding decisions
- **Realistic ranges**: When using real-world contexts, ensure values are plausible (temperatures in realistic ranges, reasonable counts for surveys, appropriate measurements)
- **Pattern inclusion**: Sometimes use numbers with visible patterns to support learning; other times use seemingly random values to test genuine understanding
- **Fraction simplification**: For probability, vary between fractions that are already simplified and those requiring simplification
- **Mean calculation**: Design datasets where the mean is sometimes a whole number and sometimes requires decimal representation

## Probability Language and Concepts

Students at this level should work with appropriate probability vocabulary:

- Use terms "certain," "impossible," "probable," "likely," "unlikely" in context
- Express probability as fractions (number of favorable outcomes over total outcomes)
- Distinguish between situations where outcomes are equally likely versus not equally likely
- Compare theoretical probability (what should happen based on analysis) with experimental results (what actually happened in trials)
- Understand that more trials generally produce results closer to theoretical probability

## Statistical Reasoning Guidance

Encourage development of analytical thinking:

- Ask students to identify which dataset has a higher mean without calculating both (estimation)
- Present scenarios where understanding the meaning of the mean is important (e.g., fair distribution)
- Include questions about what happens to the mean when a value is added or removed
- Prompt consideration of outliers (unusually high or low values) and their effect
- Ask interpretive questions beyond calculation ("What does this mean tell us about...?")

## Context Selection Principles

Choose contexts that are:
- **Age-appropriate**: Situations 9-10 year olds can understand and relate to
- **Diverse**: Vary between school contexts, home situations, sports, nature, games, and community activities
- **Culturally inclusive**: Avoid assumptions about specific cultural practices or resources
- **Gender-neutral**: Unless specifically practicing with gendered data (e.g., comparing boys' and girls' survey responses as a valid statistical exercise)
- **Motivating**: Situations that spark curiosity or connect to students' interests

Examples of context categories (describe variations within these, don't copy these phrases):
- Classroom surveys and investigations
- Sports scores and statistics
- Weather and temperature tracking
- Game outcomes and experiments with randomizers
- Collection and hobby data
- School event planning
- Nature observations

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not create tasks that:
- Use the same numbers repeatedly across different problems
- Present diagrams with unclear labels or ambiguous scales
- Require statistical knowledge beyond grade 4 level (median, mode, range)
- Use probability situations that are not clearly defined or have ambiguous outcomes
- Include datasets so large that calculation becomes tedious rather than educational
- Focus purely on procedure without connecting to meaning or application
- Use contexts that are outdated or not relatable to current students
- Present probability as percentages (stick to fractions for this grade level)

## Formula and Mathematical Notation

When tasks require calculating the mean:
- Describe the process conceptually (add all values and divide by how many values there are)
- Use clear mathematical language but avoid formal notation like sigma or complex algebraic representations
- For younger students, show the calculation structure in words; for older students, expect them to set it up independently

For probability:
- Express as fractions using clear language about numerator (favorable outcomes) and denominator (total possible outcomes)
- Use standard fraction notation
- When appropriate, prompt students to simplify fractions to lowest terms

## Integration with Other Mathematical Skills

These tasks naturally incorporate:
- **Addition**: Summing values to find totals or calculate means
- **Division**: Dividing totals by count to find means
- **Fractions**: Understanding and simplifying probability fractions
- **Comparison**: Using greater than, less than, equal to
- **Measurement**: Often working with measured data (lengths, weights, temperatures)
- **Number sense**: Estimating reasonableness of results

Leverage these connections to reinforce multiple skills within data analysis contexts.
