name: Data Analysis and Statistics
description: Analyzing diagrams, calculating arithmetic mean, comparing datasets, and understanding probability concepts
grade: 4
ages:
  - 9
  - 10
focus: Data, frequency and probability
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Interpret and analyze various complex diagram types including bar charts, pictographs, and tables
  - Calculate and understand the arithmetic mean (average) of datasets
  - Compare and analyze different datasets to identify patterns and relationships
  - Express probability as fractions and understand the difference between certain, impossible, and probable events
  - Compare theoretical and experimental probability through simple experiments
prerequisites:
  - grade3-collecting-and-representing-data
real_world_context: Students apply data analysis skills to real-world situations such as analyzing weather patterns, sports statistics, survey results, and making predictions based on collected data
problem_types:
  - Diagram Interpretation
  - Mean Calculation
  - Dataset Comparison
  - Probability Expression
  - Theoretical vs Experimental
  - Data Collection Planning
  - Missing Data Problems
  - Real-world Analysis
  - Probability Scenarios
  - Error Detection
age_guidelines:
  9:
    - Provide more structured guidance with step-by-step prompts
    - Use smaller datasets (typically 4-8 data points)
    - Include visual diagrams already created rather than requiring interpretation from raw data
    - Focus on whole numbers and simple fractions for probability (halves, quarters)
    - Use familiar, concrete contexts (classroom activities, favorite colors, pets)
    - Provide vocabulary support for terms like "mean," "average," "certain," "impossible," "probable"
    - Break complex tasks into multiple smaller questions
  10:
    - Present more open-ended questions requiring independent reasoning
    - Use larger datasets (up to 12-15 data points)
    - Mix diagram interpretation with data table reading
    - Include probability scenarios with more outcomes (sixths, eighths, tenths)
    - Use more varied contexts including abstract or less familiar situations
    - Expect students to explain their reasoning and justify conclusions
    - Combine multiple skills in single problems (e.g., calculate mean AND compare datasets)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Datasets with 4-6 values, mostly whole numbers below 20
    - Direct reading from clearly labeled diagrams
    - Mean calculation with helpful structure (sum provided or very small numbers)
    - Probability with 2-4 equally likely outcomes
    - Single-step questions with clear wording
    - Familiar everyday contexts
    - Comparison questions with obvious differences
  medium:
    - Datasets with 6-10 values, whole numbers up to 100
    - Diagrams requiring careful interpretation or combining information from multiple parts
    - Mean calculation requiring both addition and division
    - Probability with 4-8 outcomes, some requiring simplification of fractions
    - Two-step problems requiring intermediate calculation or reasoning
    - Mix of familiar and somewhat novel contexts
    - Comparison requiring numerical calculation or closer analysis
  hard:
    - Datasets with 8-15 values, numbers over 100 or including decimals (one decimal place)
    - Complex diagrams with multiple data series or requiring inference
    - Mean calculation with strategic thinking (finding missing values, working backwards from mean)
    - Probability scenarios with 8+ outcomes or compound events (two-step experiments)
    - Multi-step problems requiring planning and strategic approach
    - Abstract or unfamiliar contexts requiring transfer of knowledge
    - Comparison and analysis requiring sophisticated reasoning about relationships between measures
