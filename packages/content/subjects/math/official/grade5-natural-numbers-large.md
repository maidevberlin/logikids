description: >-
  Understanding natural numbers beyond 1 million, place value to billions,
  Roman numerals, and comparing different number systems
grade: 5
focus: Place value and number systems for very large numbers
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand place value up to billions (Milliarden)
  - Read and write very large numbers in digits and words
  - Convert between Roman and Arabic numerals (up to 3999)
  - Compare and contrast decimal and Roman numeral systems
  - Round large numbers to appropriate place values
  - Use powers of 10 for representing large numbers
real_world_context:
  - World population statistics and demographic data
  - Astronomical distances in the solar system
  - National budgets and large financial figures in news reports
  - Historical dates and events using Roman numerals
  - Scientific notation for expressing very large quantities
problem_types:
  - Place value identification
  - Roman numeral conversion
  - Number comparison
  - Ordering sequences
  - Rounding practice
  - Powers of ten notation
  - Number writing
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Numbers to 10 million with clear place value structure
    - Roman numerals to 100 (I to C)
    - Simple rounding to nearest million
  medium:
    - Numbers to 1 billion with mixed place values
    - Roman numerals to 1000 (including D and M)
    - Rounding to various place values (millions, hundred millions)
  hard:
    - Numbers beyond 1 billion requiring careful place value analysis
    - Roman numerals to 3999 with complex combinations
    - Powers of 10 notation and conversion between formats
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid negative numbers (separate concept)
  - Don't mix with decimal notation in the same problem
  - Avoid Roman numerals beyond 3999 (no standard representation)
  - Don't include arithmetic operations with large numbers
  - Avoid abstract contexts - always ground in real-world examples
