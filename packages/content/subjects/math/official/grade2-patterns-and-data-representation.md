# Task Generation Guidelines for Patterns and Data Representation

Generate tasks that help second-graders recognize patterns, represent data visually, and develop intuitive understanding of probability through exploration and comparison.

## Core Concept Areas

### 1. Arithmetic Patterns and Sequences

**What to create:** Tasks where children identify rules in number sequences and extend them forward or backward.

**Pattern structure variations:**
- Constant addition patterns (counting by same number each time)
- Constant subtraction patterns (counting backward by same number)
- Growing patterns with visual representations (objects arranged in increasing groups)
- Alternating patterns combining two simple rules
- Patterns with missing elements to identify
- Pattern rules stated in words that students apply to generate sequences
- Reverse tasks where students describe the rule from a given sequence

**Numerical complexity based on {{age}}:**
- Age 7: Sequences within 0-20, simple single-digit steps (count by 2s, 5s, 10s)
- Age 8: Sequences within 0-100, larger steps, some two-digit increments

**Difficulty scaling:**
- Easy: Short sequences (4-6 numbers), obvious patterns, forward extension only
- Medium: Longer sequences (6-8 numbers), backward extension, finding missing elements
- Hard: Multiple missing elements, describing rules in words, creating own sequences following given rules

### 2. Data Collection and Representation

**What to create:** Tasks involving collecting, organizing, and displaying information using various chart types.

**Data representation types:**
- Tally marks for counting and organizing
- Pictographs where each picture represents one item
- Pictographs where each symbol represents multiple items (simple scales like 1 picture = 2 items)
- Bar charts with labeled axes
- Converting between tally marks, pictographs, and bar charts
- Reading information from given charts
- Creating charts from described scenarios or data sets

**Context variations for data:**
Vary the subject matter being counted or measured: favorite activities, animal observations, weather patterns over a week, classroom objects, survey results, plant growth tracking, collection inventories.

**Age-based complexity:**
- Age 7: Direct reading from charts, simple tally counting, one-to-one pictographs
- Age 8: Creating charts from data, scaled pictographs, comparing multiple data sets

**Difficulty scaling:**
- Easy: Read single values from chart, create simple tally marks
- Medium: Compare two categories, find totals, create complete bar chart from data
- Hard: Answer questions requiring computation from chart data, determine best chart type for scenario

### 3. Comparing Probabilities and Likelihood

**What to create:** Tasks that develop intuitive understanding of probability through comparison and appropriate vocabulary.

**Probability comparison activities:**
- Comparing likelihood of events using language (impossible, unlikely, likely, certain)
- Determining which of two events is more likely based on described scenarios
- Ordering events from least to most likely
- Identifying impossible vs. certain events
- Predicting outcomes of simple experiments
- Explaining why one outcome is more likely than another
- Matching probability words to real-world situations

**Scenario types:**
Vary contexts where probability applies: drawing objects from containers, weather predictions, game outcomes, daily events, natural phenomena, simple experiments with coins or dice.

**Age-based scaffolding:**
- Age 7: Binary comparisons (more likely/less likely), extreme cases (impossible/certain)
- Age 8: Four-level categorization (impossible/unlikely/likely/certain), ordering multiple events

**Difficulty levels:**
- Easy: Identify obvious impossible or certain events, simple more/less likely comparisons
- Medium: Use all four probability terms correctly, order 3-4 events by likelihood
- Hard: Explain reasoning for probability judgments, relate to fair/unfair situations

### 4. Conducting Simple Random Experiments

**What to create:** Tasks involving planning, conducting, and documenting outcomes of probability experiments.

**Experiment structures:**
- Drawing colored objects from containers
- Spinning simple spinners with equal or unequal sections
- Rolling dice (standard or custom)
- Flipping coins
- Drawing cards from small sets
- Selecting items without looking

**Documentation formats:**
Describe how to record results using tally marks, simple tables, or pictographs showing outcome frequency.

**Task variations:**
- Predicting before conducting experiment
- Recording results after multiple trials
- Comparing predicted vs. actual results
- Determining if experiment is fair or unfair
- Modifying experiment to change probabilities
- Creating experiments that match given probability descriptions

**Complexity by age:**
- Age 7: Very simple experiments (2-3 outcomes), qualitative predictions
- Age 8: More outcome options, quantitative recording (how many times each outcome)

**Difficulty scaling:**
- Easy: Conduct experiment and record results, make simple predictions
- Medium: Compare fairness of different setups, analyze recorded results
- Hard: Design experiment to match specific probability criteria, explain why results differ from predictions

## Cross-Cutting Variation Principles

### Numerical Ranges and Values

**For patterns:** Describe varying starting points (not always beginning with 1 or 0), different step sizes within age-appropriate ranges, both ascending and descending sequences.

**For data values:** Describe using diverse quantities in different scales (single digits to appropriate two-digit values for age 8), avoiding predictable or round numbers exclusively.

**For experiment trials:** Describe varying the number of repetitions (from handful to couple dozen trials) based on complexity.

### Visual Representation Guidance

**For charts and graphs:** Describe showing both horizontal and vertical orientations, different category labels, varied scales on axes appropriate to the data.

**For patterns:** Describe showing patterns with both numbers alone and numbers accompanied by visual elements (shapes, colors, concrete objects).

**For probability experiments:** Describe representing equipment and results visually without providing specific drawings or diagrams.

### Problem Structures

Vary the cognitive demand:
- Direct application (read the chart, continue the pattern)
- Analysis (what's the rule, which category has most)
- Synthesis (create a chart for this data, design an experiment)
- Comparison (which pattern grows faster, which event is more likely)
- Error analysis (find the mistake in this pattern, explain why this chart is incorrect)
- Open-ended creation (make your own pattern with this rule)

### Real-World Integration

Connect to second-grader experiences: classroom activities, playground games, family situations, nature observations, daily routines, simple experiments with household items.

Describe scenarios that are age-appropriate and culturally neutral, avoiding assumptions about specific family structures, possessions, or activities.

## Language and Presentation

### Age-Appropriate Vocabulary

**For age 7:** Use simple, direct language. Define terms like "pattern," "chart," "tally," "likely" in context.

**For age 8:** Introduce more precise mathematical vocabulary while maintaining clarity. Can use terms like "sequence," "bar chart," "probability," "outcome."

### Question Formats

Vary between:
- Direct questions (What comes next? How many chose...?)
- Instruction-based (Create a bar chart showing..., Extend this pattern...)
- Comparison prompts (Which is more likely? Which pattern grows faster?)
- Explanation requests (Why is this event impossible? How do you know?)
- Open tasks (Make a pattern that..., Conduct an experiment where...)

### Visual Organization

Describe presenting information clearly with appropriate spacing, labeled sections, and organized layouts. For younger children (age 7), use more visual support. For older children (age 8), can include more text-based presentations.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Do not:**
- Provide actual SVG code for charts, graphs, or visual patterns
- Include specific LaTeX formulas (pattern work at this level is numerical, not algebraic)
- Use identical data sets or pattern sequences across multiple tasks
- Always start patterns at 1 or use only multiples of 5 and 10
- Create charts with exactly 5 categories every time
- Use only coin flips and dice for probability
- Make all bar charts vertical or all data sets sum to nice round numbers
- Present probability only through games; include natural and everyday contexts
- Use culturally specific scenarios that assume particular backgrounds

**Instead:**
- Describe what visual elements should show (bars comparing heights, symbols arranged in rows)
- Describe the range and variation principles for numbers
- Vary contexts, structures, and representation types
- Include diverse pattern rules and irregular data distributions
- Use age-appropriate but varied probability scenarios

## Task Type Recommendations

**For pattern tasks:**
- Multiple choice: Identify next number or missing element from options
- Fill-in-blank: Complete sequence with one or more missing numbers
- Open-ended: Describe the rule, create pattern following given rule

**For data representation tasks:**
- Multiple choice: Answer questions about chart interpretation
- Constructed response: Create chart from data, fill in chart elements
- Analysis: Compare categories, find totals, draw conclusions

**For probability tasks:**
- Matching: Connect events to likelihood terms
- Ordering: Arrange events from least to most likely
- Explanation: Justify why one event is more/less likely than another

Mix task types to maintain engagement and assess different competencies.

## Success Indicators

Generated tasks should:
- Match cognitive level of 7-8 year olds (concrete operations stage)
- Use numbers and quantities within grade 2 curriculum scope (0-100)
- Present patterns that follow clear, discoverable rules
- Show data in age-appropriate chart types (tally, pictograph, simple bar chart)
- Use probability language correctly and contextually
- Avoid assumptions about prerequisite knowledge beyond grade 1
- Connect to familiar, concrete experiences
- Encourage mathematical thinking beyond rote procedures
