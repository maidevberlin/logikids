name: Patterns and Data Representation
description: Recognize number patterns, create charts, and compare event probabilities
grade: 2
ages:
  - 7
  - 8
focus: Patterns, structures, data representation, and basic probability
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and extend arithmetic number patterns
  - Create and interpret bar charts and pictographs
  - Compare probabilities using appropriate language
  - Conduct and record simple random experiments
prerequisites:
  - grade1-number-concept-development
  - grade1-collecting-data
  - grade1-recognizing-patterns
real_world_context: Patterns help understand number sequences and growth. Charts organize surveys, weather tracking, and collections. Probability applies to games, weather predictions, and everyday choices.
problem_types:
  - Number sequences
  - Pattern rules
  - Bar charts
  - Pictographs
  - Tally marks
  - Data comparison
  - Likelihood comparison
  - Probability experiments
  - Chart creation
  - Missing elements
age_guidelines:
  7:
    - Use sequences within 0-20 with simple single-digit steps (2s, 5s, 10s)
    - Direct reading from charts and one-to-one pictographs
    - Simple tally counting and basic chart interpretation
    - Binary probability comparisons (more/less likely) and extreme cases (impossible/certain)
    - Very simple experiments with 2-3 outcomes and qualitative predictions
    - Simple, direct language with terms defined in context
  8:
    - Use sequences within 0-100 with larger steps and two-digit increments
    - Creating charts from data and using scaled pictographs
    - Comparing multiple data sets and finding totals from charts
    - Four-level probability categorization (impossible/unlikely/likely/certain)
    - Experiments with more outcome options and quantitative recording
    - More precise mathematical vocabulary while maintaining clarity
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Short sequences (4-6 numbers) with obvious patterns
    - Forward extension only
    - Read single values from charts
    - Create simple tally marks
    - Identify obvious impossible or certain events
    - Simple more/less likely comparisons
    - Conduct experiment and record results with simple predictions
  medium:
    - Longer sequences (6-8 numbers) with backward extension
    - Finding missing elements in patterns
    - Compare two categories and find totals
    - Create complete bar chart from data
    - Use all four probability terms correctly
    - Order 3-4 events by likelihood
    - Compare fairness of different experimental setups
    - Analyze recorded results
  hard:
    - Multiple missing elements in sequences
    - Describing pattern rules in words
    - Creating own sequences following given rules
    - Answer questions requiring computation from chart data
    - Determine best chart type for given scenario
    - Explain reasoning for probability judgments
    - Relate to fair/unfair situations
    - Design experiment to match specific probability criteria
    - Explain why results differ from predictions
