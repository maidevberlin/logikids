name: Two-Dimensional Geometric Shapes
description: Properties and classification of basic 2D shapes including triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles
grade: 5
ages: [10, 11]
focus: Plane geometry - properties, classification, symmetry, and basic constructions
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Identify, describe, and classify geometric figures based on their properties
  - Recognize and construct axis and point symmetry in figures
  - Use geometric tools (compass, ruler, protractor) for basic constructions
  - Measure, estimate, and draw angles up to 360°
prerequisites: []
real_world_context: 'Architectural elements, street signs, tiles, patterns in nature, geometric art, building designs'
version: 1
version_notes: 'Initial migration to frontmatter-based format. Extracted problem types, age guidelines, and difficulty guidelines from original prose content.'
problem_types:
  - Shape identification
  - Property classification
  - Symmetry analysis
  - Angle measurement
  - Construction reasoning
  - Shape comparison
  - Error analysis
  - Real-world applications
age_guidelines:
  10:
    - Use clear visual representations with distinct shapes
    - Focus on basic shape identification and simple properties
    - Introduce symmetry concepts with visual aids
    - Present angles in standard orientations initially
    - Use everyday contexts (signs, tiles, buildings)
    - Provide visual markers for equal sides and angles when needed
  11:
    - Increase complexity with combined properties
    - Present shapes in various orientations and scales
    - Explore multiple symmetry types and orders
    - Include angle calculations and relationships
    - Challenge with composite figures and comparisons
    - Reduce visual aids to promote deeper property understanding
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct identification of common shapes (triangles, rectangles, squares)
    - Single-property recognition (e.g., "has right angles")
    - Counting sides, vertices, or symmetry lines
    - Basic angle type classification (acute, right, obtuse)
    - Identifying symmetry when axis is shown
    - Simple tool selection for constructions
  medium:
    - Multi-property classification (e.g., "equal sides AND right angles")
    - Distinguishing between similar shapes (rectangle vs. parallelogram)
    - Determining number of symmetry lines without visual aids
    - Angle relationships (complementary, supplementary)
    - Step-by-step construction reasoning
    - Shape comparisons and shared properties
  hard:
    - Hierarchical classification (square is a special rectangle)
    - Complex symmetry analysis (point symmetry orders)
    - Reflex angle identification and measurement
    - Error analysis in constructions or classifications
    - Composite figures with multiple shapes
    - Inverse reasoning ("which is NOT..." questions)
