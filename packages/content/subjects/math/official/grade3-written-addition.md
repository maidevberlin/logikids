# Written Addition

Generate a task where {{name}} performs written addition with multi-digit numbers, using the standard algorithm with carrying, appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Focus on the column method (vertical addition) with numbers up to 1000, including carrying (regrouping).

Use varied approaches:

**Standard Three-Digit Addition:**
- Present addition problems requiring the column method
- Example: "Calculate $456 + 378$ using the written addition method."

```
  456
+ 378
-----
  834
```

- Show carrying: $6 + 8 = 14$ (write $4$, carry $1$)
- Vary which columns require carrying

**Addition with Carrying in Multiple Columns:**
- Create problems requiring carries in 2 or 3 places
- Example: "Add $567 + 485$"

```
  ¹ ¹
  567
+ 485
-----
 1052
```

- Ones: $7 + 5 = 12$ (carry $1$)
- Tens: $6 + 8 + 1 = 15$ (carry $1$)
- Hundreds: $5 + 4 + 1 = 10$

**Two-Digit Plus Three-Digit:**
- Mix different numbers of digits
- Example: "Calculate $87 + 456$"
- Emphasize place value alignment

**Estimation Before Calculating:**
- Ask students to estimate first by rounding
- Example: "Estimate $423 + 298$ by rounding to the nearest hundred, then calculate the exact answer."
- Estimate: $400 + 300 = 700$; Exact: $423 + 298 = 721$

**Checking Answers:**
- Use estimation to verify if the answer is reasonable
- Example: "Lisa calculated $356 + 287 = 543$. Is this reasonable? Check by estimating."
- Estimate: $400 + 300 = 700$, so $543$ seems too small (error: should be $643$)

**Real-World Word Problems:**
- Apply written addition to practical situations
- Example: "A bookstore sold $348$ books on Monday and $276$ books on Tuesday. How many books did they sell in total?"
- Contexts: shopping totals, distances, collections, attendance

**Multiple Addends:**
- Add three numbers using the column method
- Example: "Calculate $245 + 186 + 329$"

```
  245
  186
+ 329
-----
  760
```

**Missing Digit Problems:**
- Present problems with missing digits that students find
- Example: "Complete this addition: $4\_8 + 2\_5 = 723$. What are the missing digits?"

**Explaining the Algorithm:**
- Ask students to explain the steps or identify errors
- Example: "Tim added $456 + 287$ and got $633$. What mistake did he make?"
- Common error: forgetting to carry or adding carried digit incorrectly

**Place Value Emphasis:**
- Highlight the importance of column alignment
- Example: "Why is it important to line up the ones, tens, and hundreds columns when adding?"

Use step-by-step worked examples when helpful. Show carrying notation clearly using superscript or carets: $^1$ above the column. Include LaTeX for all numbers and calculations. Vary the numbers to create different carrying scenarios: some with no carries, some with one carry, some with multiple carries.
