id: grade7-parallel-translation
name: Parallel Translation and Vectors
description: Parallel displacement as congruence mapping, translation vectors, coordinate calculations
grade: 7
focus: Geometric transformations and vector concepts
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand parallel translation as a congruence-preserving transformation
  - Describe translations using vectors with direction and distance
  - Perform translations of points and figures on the coordinate plane
  - Calculate coordinates of translated points using vector addition
  - Identify properties preserved under translation (shape, size, angle measures)
  - Recognize that all points move the same distance in the same direction
  - Apply translations to solve geometric and real-world problems
problem_types:
  - Vector identification
  - Point translation
  - Figure translation
  - Coordinate calculation
  - Multiple translations
  - Translation properties
  - Inverse translation
  - Real-world applications
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Translate single points or simple shapes using given vectors on a grid
    - Identify translation vectors from before/after positions
    - Calculate new coordinates with horizontal or vertical translations only
  medium:
    - Translate complex figures using diagonal vectors without grids
    - Apply multiple sequential translations and find the combined result
    - Determine the translation vector needed to map one figure onto another
  hard:
    - Solve multi-step problems combining translations with other concepts
    - Prove properties are preserved under translation using coordinates
    - Apply translations in real-world contexts requiring modeling and interpretation
prerequisites:
  - grade6-geometric-constructions
  - grade6-angles-advanced
real_world_context:
  - Computer graphics and animation use translation vectors to move objects smoothly across screens in games and videos
  - Architects and urban planners translate building designs to different locations on site plans while preserving exact dimensions
  - GPS navigation systems calculate position changes as translation vectors when tracking movement from one location to another
  - Robotics engineers program robot movements as sequences of translation vectors to navigate from point to point
  - Pattern designers use repeated translations to create tessellations and wallpaper patterns in textiles and decoration
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing translation with rotation or reflection in the same problem
  - Don't use vectors with components larger than 10 units in magnitude
  - Avoid coordinate values outside the range -20 to 20
  - Don't describe translations using only distances without direction
  - Avoid figures with more than 8 vertices for translation tasks
