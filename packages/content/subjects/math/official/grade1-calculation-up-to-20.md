# Calculation up to 20

Generate addition and subtraction tasks within the number range 0-20. Focus on crossing tens (bridging through 10) and understanding place value with ones and tens.

## Task Variations

### 1. Addition Without Crossing Ten
Addition where the result stays within a ten:

Calculate: ${{num1}} + {{num2}} = ?$

Where the sum is ≤ 20 and doesn't require bridging through 10.

**Example:** Calculate: $12 + 5 = ?$ (stays in the teens)

---

### 2. Addition With Crossing Ten (Bridging)
Addition that requires crossing through 10:

Calculate by crossing the ten: ${{num1}} + {{num2}} = ?$

Break down: ${{num1}} + {{num2}} = {{num1}} + {{part1}} + {{part2}}$

**Example:** $8 + 7 = 8 + 2 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15$

---

### 3. Subtraction Without Crossing Ten
Subtraction within the same ten:

Calculate: ${{num1}} - {{num2}} = ?$

Where no bridging through 10 is needed.

**Example:** Calculate: $18 - 6 = ?$

---

### 4. Subtraction With Crossing Ten
Subtraction that crosses through 10:

Calculate: ${{num1}} - {{num2}} = ?$

Break down by subtracting to 10 first, then the rest.

**Example:** $15 - 8 = 15 - 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$

---

### 5. Adding to Tens Numbers
Adding single digits to 10:

Calculate: $10 + {{num}} = ?$

**Example:** Calculate: $10 + 7 = ?$

---

### 6. Story Problems in Range 20
Real-world word problems:

{{name}} has ${{num1}}$ {{object}}. {{He/She}} {{action}} ${{num2}}$ more. How many does {{name}} have now?

**Example:** Maria has 13 marbles. She finds 6 more. How many marbles does she have now?

---

### 7. Missing Number Problems
Find the missing addend or subtrahend:

${{num1}} + \text{?} = {{sum}}$

or

${{num1}} - \text{?} = {{result}}$

**Example:** $14 + ? = 19$ or $17 - ? = 9$

---

### 8. Place Value Decomposition
Break numbers into tens and ones:

Write ${{num}}$ as tens and ones:

$${{num}} = 10 + {{ones}}$$

**Example:** Write 16 as tens and ones: $16 = 10 + 6$

---

### 9. Comparison with Difference
Calculate how much more or less:

{{name1}} has ${{num1}}$ {{object}}. {{name2}} has ${{num2}}$ {{object}}. How many {{more/fewer}} does {{name1}} have?

**Example:** Tom has 18 cards. Lisa has 11 cards. How many more does Tom have?
