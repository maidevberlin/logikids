# Combinatorics

Create tasks where {{child_name}} uses systematic counting methods and tree diagrams to solve combinatorial problems appropriate for grade 5 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Basic Multiplication Principle**: Simple two-stage choices. "You have {{3-5}} types of bread and {{3-5}} types of cheese. How many different sandwiches can you make?" Vary the context (shirts/pants, ice cream flavors/toppings, etc.) and numbers.

2. **Tree Diagrams for Two Events**: Ask students to draw or complete a tree diagram for scenarios like flipping a coin twice, rolling a die and flipping a coin, or choosing from two categories. Include {{2-3}} outcomes per stage.

3. **Three-Stage Problems**: Extend to three choices. "A restaurant offers {{2-3}} appetizers, {{3-4}} main courses, and {{2-3}} desserts. How many different three-course meals are possible?" Include both calculation and explanation.

4. **Ordered Arrangements**: How many different {{2-3}} digit numbers can you make using the digits {{provide 3-4 distinct digits}}? May include restriction like "without repeating digits" or "allowing repetition."

5. **Systematic Listing**: Present a problem requiring organized listing. "List all possible ways to arrange the letters A, B, C" or "Find all different ways to make {{target amount}} cents using {{specific coins}}." Vary the number of items ({{2-4}}).

6. **Path Counting**: Simple grid problems. "How many different paths are there from point A to point B if you can only move right or up?" Use small grids ({{2×2}} or {{3×2}}).

7. **Combination vs. Permutation Intuition**: Without formal terminology, distinguish between order-matters and order-doesn't-matter scenarios. "Is choosing 2 friends for a team the same as choosing a first and second place winner?" Use concrete examples.

8. **Tree Diagram Probability**: Use tree diagrams to find probabilities of compound events. "What's the probability of getting exactly one heads when flipping {{2}} coins?" Connect counting to probability.

Present problems in engaging contexts: sports teams, party planning, games, passwords, pizza orders. Keep numbers manageable (products typically under 50). Encourage systematic approaches: tables, tree diagrams, organized lists. Include both "how many ways" questions and "list all possibilities" tasks.
