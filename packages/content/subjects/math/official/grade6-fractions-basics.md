id: grade6-fractions-basics
name: Fractions and Fractional Numbers
description: Interpreting fractions as parts of wholes, comparing fractions using multiple strategies, extending and reducing fractions while preserving value, representing fractions on number lines including negative fractions, and connecting percentages to fraction notation
grade: 6
focus: Fraction interpretation and equivalence
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Interpret and visualize proportions using circle and rectangle diagrams
  - Determine parts, fractional parts, and corresponding wholes from given information
  - Explain why extending and reducing fractions do not change their value
  - Compare fractions using appropriate strategies (common denominators, cross-multiplication, benchmark fractions)
  - Recognize percentages as alternative fraction notation (e.g., 40% = 40/100 = 2/5)
  - Represent positive and negative fractions on number lines with proper spacing
  - Describe connections between natural numbers, whole numbers, and rational numbers
problem_types:
  - Visual proportion analysis
  - Part-whole determination
  - Extending fractions
  - Reducing fractions
  - Fraction comparison
  - Percentage conversion
  - Number line positioning
  - Equivalent fraction chains
  - Mixed number representation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple extending/reducing with small factors (2, 3, 5)
    - Comparing fractions with denominators up to 12
    - Converting common percentages (25%, 50%, 75%, 10%, 20%)
  medium:
    - Extending/reducing requiring identification of greatest common divisor
    - Comparing fractions requiring least common multiple up to 60
    - Converting percentages requiring calculation (35%, 65%, 15%)
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining extending, reducing, and comparing
    - Negative fractions on number lines with proper ordering
    - Complex percentage-fraction connections (e.g., 37.5% = 3/8)
prerequisites:
  - grade5-fractions-operations
  - grade5-divisibility-prime-numbers
real_world_context:
  - Sale discounts in stores expressed as percentages and fractions
  - Comparing recipe proportions from different sources (2/3 cup vs 4/6 cup)
  - Understanding test scores as fractions and percentages (15/20 = 75%)
  - Analyzing survey results showing fractions of respondents
  - Reading nutritional labels showing fractions and percentages of daily values
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid denominators larger than 100 (except percentages)
  - Don't introduce fraction multiplication or division
  - Avoid complex decimal-fraction conversions
  - Don't combine multiple operations in single problems
  - Avoid contexts requiring repeating decimals understanding
