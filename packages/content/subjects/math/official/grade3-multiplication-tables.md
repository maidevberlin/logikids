name: Multiplication Tables (2-10)
description: Master multiplication facts from 2×2 to 10×10 and apply them in various contexts.
grade: 3
ages:
  - 8
  - 9
focus: Numbers and Operations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Recall multiplication facts for tables 2 through 10 automatically
  - Apply commutative property to solve multiplication problems
  - Solve word problems involving multiplication in real-world contexts
  - Recognize patterns and relationships within multiplication tables
  - Use multiplication to solve division problems
problem_types:
  - Missing factor
  - Comparison
  - Pattern recognition
  - Multiple steps
  - Direct calculation
  - Division connection
  - Commutative property
  - Error detection
  - Strategy selection
  - Real-world application
age_guidelines:
  8:
    - Focus on tables 2-5 primarily
    - Single-step problems
    - Visual or concrete context hints
    - Smaller products (under 50)
    - More direct calculation tasks
  9:
    - Include all tables 2-10
    - Multi-step problems
    - Abstract reasoning required
    - Larger products (up to 100)
    - More complex problem structures
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Tables 2, 5, 10 emphasized
    - Direct calculation or simple missing factor
    - Products under 30
    - Clear context with obvious operation
  medium:
    - All tables 2-10 equally
    - Multi-step or comparison tasks
    - Products up to 70
    - Requires strategy selection
  hard:
    - Complex combinations (6, 7, 8, 9 tables)
    - Multiple operations or error detection
    - Products up to 100
    - Abstract reasoning or pattern analysis
real_world_context: Practical scenarios involving groups and repeated quantities such as shopping (packs of items, total cost), measurement (arrays, area), time (days in weeks), nature (animal legs, flower petals), sports (teams, equipment), food (portions, packages, recipes), school (students in rows, supplies), and travel (vehicles, passengers)
prerequisites:
  - addition-subtraction-100
version: 1
version_notes: Migrated to frontmatter-based format with extracted problem types and guidelines. Removed curriculum_research field as it's not part of the schema.
