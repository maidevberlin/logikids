# Multiplication Tables (2-10)

Generate varied multiplication tasks using tables 2-10. Tasks must adapt to age and difficulty while ensuring diverse problem structures and contexts.

## TASK GENERATION PROTOCOL

Before generating each task, you MUST:

1. **Select structure**: Choose ONE from the 10 structures below (rotate, never repeat)
2. **Select factors**: Choose TWO factors from 2-10 that haven't been used in recent tasks
3. **Select context**: Choose ONE context from the list that hasn't been used recently
4. **Select phrasing**: Choose ONE phrasing approach that varies from the previous task

Do NOT simply describe a multiplication scenario. Follow the structure template exactly.

## Problem Structures

**MANDATORY ROTATION**: Select ONE structure from this list for each task. Use a different structure for each consecutive task. Within any 5 tasks, use at least 4 different structures.

### Structure Descriptions with Examples

1. **Missing factor**: Given product and one factor, find the other
   - Example: "I bought some packs of stickers. Each pack has 8 stickers. I have 56 stickers total. How many packs did I buy?"
   - The student must find: ? × 8 = 56

2. **Comparison**: Compare products or identify larger/smaller results
   - Example: "Which is larger: 7 × 8 or 9 × 6? Show your thinking."
   - Student must calculate both and compare

3. **Pattern recognition**: Complete sequences or identify table patterns
   - Example: "Look at this pattern: 5, 10, 15, 20, __, 30. What number is missing?"
   - Student identifies multiplication table pattern

4. **Multiple steps**: Combine multiplication with addition or subtraction
   - Example: "You have 5 boxes with 8 cookies each. You eat 3 cookies. How many are left?"
   - Student must calculate: (5 × 8) - 3

5. **Direct calculation**: Find the product of two factors
   - Example: "Calculate 7 × 9"
   - Student finds product directly

6. **Division connection**: Use multiplication knowledge to solve division
   - Example: "There are 42 apples. We want to put them in bags of 6. How many bags do we need?"
   - Student uses 6 × ? = 42 to find answer

7. **Commutative property**: Demonstrate that order doesn't affect product
   - Example: "Show that 4 × 9 equals 9 × 4. Explain why this works."
   - Student proves order independence

8. **Error detection**: Identify incorrect calculations
   - Example: "Tom says 7 × 8 = 54. Is he correct? If not, what's the right answer?"
   - Student verifies and corrects

9. **Strategy selection**: Choose efficient multiplication approaches
   - Example: "To find 5 × 12, would you rather calculate 5 × 10 + 5 × 2, or count by 5s twelve times? Explain."
   - Student analyzes different strategies

10. **Real-world application**: Multiplication in practical contexts requiring interpretation
    - Example: "A recipe needs 3 cups of flour. You want to make 4 batches. The flour bag has 15 cups total. Do you have enough?"
    - Student must interpret context and apply multiplication

**AVOID**: Using direct calculation more than twice in any 5 consecutive tasks.

## Number Variation Principles

**CRITICAL: Distribute factors evenly across the full range to prevent repetition.**

### Mandatory Distribution Requirements

**FORBIDDEN PATTERN**: Do not use 6 or 7 as factors in more than 1 out of every 5 tasks.

**REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION**: Within each set of 5 tasks, use factors from these ranges:
- At least one task with factors from {2, 3}
- At least one task with factors from {4, 5}
- At least one task with factors from {8, 9}
- Exactly one task may use 10 as a factor
- Factors 6 and 7 should appear sparingly (maximum 2 times across 5 tasks combined)

### Additional Variation Constraints

- **Range**: Use factors 2-10, distributing across full range within each difficulty
- **Distribution rule**: For every 5 tasks, ensure at least 8 different factors appear
- **Repetition limit**: No single factor should appear in more than 2 out of 5 consecutive tasks
- **Magnitude differences**: Vary small×small (2×3), small×large (2×9), medium×medium (5×6), large×large (8×9)
- **Pattern diversity**: Use consecutive numbers, gaps, related facts, prime factors (2, 3, 5, 7)
- **Randomization**: Never use same factor pair twice in succession; actively avoid recently used factors

### Examples of Good Factor Distribution
- Task 1: 3 × 8
- Task 2: 5 × 9
- Task 3: 2 × 4
- Task 4: 7 × 6
- Task 5: 4 × 10

## Age-Appropriate Scaffolding

### Younger students (age 8):
- Focus on tables 2-5 primarily
- Single-step problems
- Visual or concrete context hints
- Smaller products (under 50)
- More direct calculation tasks

### Older students (age 9):
- Include all tables 2-10
- Multi-step problems
- Abstract reasoning required
- Larger products (up to 100)
- More complex problem structures

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy:
- Tables 2, 5, 10 emphasized
- Direct calculation or simple missing factor
- Products under 30
- Clear context with obvious operation

### Medium:
- All tables 2-10 equally
- Multi-step or comparison tasks
- Products up to 70
- Requires strategy selection

### Hard:
- Complex combinations (6, 7, 8, 9 tables)
- Multiple operations or error detection
- Products up to 100
- Abstract reasoning or pattern analysis

## Task Type Adaptations

### Single Choice / Multiple Select:
- Present 3-5 answer options
- Include common errors (off-by-one-table, addition instead of multiplication)
- Mix correct answers among plausible distractors

### Fill-in-Blank:
- Require numeric answer (product or missing factor)
- Accept equivalent forms

### Number Input:
- Direct calculation results
- Missing factors

### Yes/No:
- Verify calculation correctness
- Confirm pattern statements
- Test commutative property understanding

### Ordering:
- Sort products from smallest to largest
- Arrange by factor relationships

## Real-World Context Categories

Integrate multiplication naturally into diverse scenarios:

- Shopping and money (items in packs, total cost)
- Measurement (arrays, area, groups)
- Time (days in weeks, hours in activities)
- Nature (animal legs, flower petals, sets)
- Sports (teams, scores, equipment)
- Food (portions, packages, recipes)
- School (students in rows, books, supplies)
- Travel (vehicles, passengers, distances)

Rotate contexts—never use same scenario type twice consecutively.

## Visualization Guidelines

When age ≥ 9 and difficulty ≥ medium, consider visual elements:

- **Arrays**: Show rectangular arrangements (avoid code, describe only)
- **Number lines**: Mark jumps for repeated addition connection
- **Tables**: Display partial multiplication tables with blanks

All visualizations must vary in size, orientation, and specific numbers used.

## Language and Presentation

**Vary both phrasing and problem setup to prevent formulaic patterns:**

### Question Phrasing Variations
- Direct questions: "Calculate the product", "Find how many in total", "Determine the result"
- Indirect questions: "Which answer shows...", "The correct total is...", "If you multiply..."
- Comparative: "Compare these products", "Which is larger", "Order from smallest to largest"
- Investigative: "Check whether...", "Identify the pattern", "Explain why..."

### Problem Setup Variations
- **Story-first**: Establish context and narrative before introducing numbers
- **Problem-first**: State the mathematical question, then add real-world meaning
- **Visual-first**: Describe an array or diagram, ask student to interpret
- **Error-analysis**: Present a worked solution, ask student to verify or correct

### Sentence Structure Diversity

**FORBIDDEN PHRASE**: Do NOT use "Each [item] has/needs/holds/gets X [units]" in more than 1 out of 5 tasks.

**Required Variety**: Use at least 3 different problem setup approaches from:
- **Story-first**: Establish full narrative before revealing math ("Alex loves collecting stamps. Yesterday...")
- **Problem-first**: Start with math question, add context after ("Calculate 8 × 5. This represents...")
- **Visual-first**: Describe arrangement/diagram ("Imagine 4 rows with 9 dots in each row...")
- **Error-analysis**: Present attempted solution ("Sarah calculated 6 × 7 = 40. Check her work...")
- **Discovery**: Student figures out what operation to use ("You have $20. Books cost $4 each. How many can you buy?")

**Language Patterns to Rotate**:
- Vary subject placement: Start with student, adult, animal, object
- Vary voice: Active ("You arrange..."), passive ("The books are organized...")
- Vary question position: Beginning, middle, end
- Vary formality: Conversational, instructional, narrative

**Natural Language Test**: Would a teacher say this exact phrase to a student? If it sounds template-generated or robotic, rewrite it.
