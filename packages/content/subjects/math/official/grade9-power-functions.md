id: grade9-power-functions
name: Power Functions
description: Understanding power functions with various exponents, their graphs, and relationships to radical notation
grade: 9
focus: Functions and their properties
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Describe and sketch graphs of power functions f(x) = a·xⁿ for various values of n
  - Solve equations of the form xⁿ = c for different exponents
  - Convert between radical notation and rational exponent notation
  - Apply laws of exponents with rational exponents in calculations
  - Analyze behavior of power functions including symmetry and end behavior
problem_types:
  - Graph sketching
  - Equation solving
  - Notation conversion
  - Expression simplification
  - Function analysis
  - Comparison tasks
  - Real-world modeling
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Integer exponents from 2 to 5
    - Simple conversions like x^(1/2) = √x
    - Clear numeric values
  medium:
    - Mixed integer and rational exponents
    - Multi-step conversions between forms
    - Parameter variations in f(x) = a·xⁿ
  hard:
    - Negative and rational exponents combined
    - Complex expression simplifications
    - Analyzing multiple functions simultaneously
prerequisites:
  - grade7-powers-exponents
real_world_context:
  - Surface area and volume scaling laws show power relationships (doubling size affects area by 2² and volume by 2³)
  - Physics uses power functions for gravitational force (inverse square law) and kinetic energy (velocity squared)
  - Growth rates in biology follow power laws (metabolic rate scales with body mass to the 3/4 power)
  - Engineering calculations for beam strength involve power relationships with dimensions
  - Sound intensity decreases with distance following an inverse square relationship
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing rational exponents with operations they haven't learned yet
  - Don't use exponents with absolute value greater than 5 for integer cases
  - Avoid ambiguous radical notation without clear indication of root order
  - Don't combine multiple unfamiliar concepts in one problem
  - Avoid contexts requiring advanced physics or engineering knowledge
