id: grade6-volume
name: Volume of Prisms
description: Calculate volumes of cuboids and prisms using formulas, convert between volume units, and solve problems through decomposition and complementation strategies
grade: 6
focus: Spatial measurement and calculation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand and justify the cuboid volume formula through measurement principles
  - Develop spatial understanding using unit cubes and visualization
  - Convert between volume units (cubic meters, cubic centimeters, liters, milliliters) with justification
  - Apply the cuboid volume formula flexibly to calculate volumes
  - Estimate volumes of real-world objects using appropriate strategies
  - Solve complex volume problems through decomposition into simpler cuboids
  - Solve complex volume problems through complementation methods
problem_types:
  - Direct volume calculation
  - Unit conversion
  - Missing dimension
  - Volume estimation
  - Decomposition strategy
  - Complementation strategy
  - Real-world application
  - Volume comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Cuboids with dimensions up to 20 units, simple whole numbers
    - Direct unit conversions (cm³ to L, m³ to cm³)
    - Single-step calculations with all dimensions given
  medium:
    - Cuboids with dimensions up to 100 units, may include decimals
    - Multi-step problems requiring decomposition into 2-3 simple cuboids
    - Finding missing dimensions when volume and two dimensions are given
  hard:
    - Complex shapes requiring decomposition into 4+ cuboids or complementation
    - Real-world estimation involving irregular objects
    - Multi-step problems combining volume calculation with unit conversions
prerequisites:
  - grade5-volume
  - grade4-volume-unit-cubes
  - grade4-measurement-units
real_world_context:
  - Calculating how much water fills a swimming pool or aquarium
  - Determining storage capacity of boxes, containers, or shipping packages
  - Estimating concrete needed for construction projects
  - Comparing volumes of different product packages (juice boxes, cereal boxes)
  - Calculating room volumes for heating or air conditioning requirements
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing different unit systems without clear conversion context
  - Don't use dimensions larger than 1000 or smaller than 0.1 without context
  - Avoid decomposition problems where shapes don't clearly align on a grid
  - Don't present estimation tasks without reasonable reference objects
  - Avoid confusing volume with surface area in problem statements
