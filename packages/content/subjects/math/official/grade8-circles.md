id: grade8-circles
name: Circles
description: Circle circumference, area, understanding pi, and applications with composite shapes
grade: 8
focus: Circle geometry and calculations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand the relationship between circumference and diameter using pi
  - Apply the circumference formula C = 2πr = πd
  - Apply the area formula A = πr²
  - Approximate pi through measurement and understand its significance
  - Solve problems involving circle sectors and segments
  - Apply circle formulas to composite shapes
  - Use appropriate precision with pi in calculations
problem_types:
  - Circumference calculation
  - Area calculation
  - Radius from circumference
  - Diameter from area
  - Composite shapes
  - Sector problems
  - Segment problems
  - Real-world applications
  - Pi approximation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single circle with one calculation (circumference or area)
    - Whole number radius or diameter
    - Use π ≈ 3.14 or calculator π button
  medium:
    - Multiple calculations for same circle
    - Composite shapes with 2-3 components
    - Circle sectors with given central angles
  hard:
    - Complex composite figures with 4+ components
    - Problems requiring multiple steps and formula manipulation
    - Circle segments requiring area subtraction
prerequisites:
  - grade5-geometry-basics
  - grade4-area-perimeter
real_world_context:
  - Calculating material needed for circular gardens, pools, or patios
  - Designing circular objects like wheels, plates, or clock faces
  - Determining the area covered by sprinkler systems or satellite signals
  - Calculating pizza slice areas and circular food portions
  - Measuring circular sports fields, tracks, or arenas
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid trigonometry or angle calculations beyond simple sectors
  - Don't introduce arc length formulas separately from sectors
  - Avoid circles in coordinate systems or tangent lines
  - Don't combine with advanced algebraic expressions
  - Avoid problems requiring more than 3 decimal places for pi
