    - Visual support hints acceptable (e.g., number line references)
  medium:
    - Numbers up to 20, may cross ten
    - Requires understanding of place value or making ten strategy
    - Word problems with clear single-step operations
  hard:
    - Multiple steps or inverse thinking required
    - Missing addend problems crossing ten
    - Fact families with three related equations
real_world_context:
