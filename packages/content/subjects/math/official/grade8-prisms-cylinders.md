name: Prisms and Cylinders
description: Calculate surface area and volume of prisms and cylinders, draw and interpret nets, and apply the V = base area × height formula to solve real-world problems
grade: 8
focus: Three-dimensional geometry and measurement
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Sketch prisms and cylinders with accurate representation of components
  - Identify and describe components including bases, lateral surfaces, height, and edges
  - Draw and interpret nets of prisms and cylinders
  - Derive and apply surface area formulas for prisms and cylinders
  - Derive and apply the volume formula V = base area × height
  - Connect cylinder calculations to circle formulas for base area and lateral surface

  - Cylinder-circle connection
  - Composite solid problems
  - Real-world applications
  - Formula derivation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple prisms (triangular, rectangular) with whole number dimensions under 15
    - Direct application of given formulas (V = base area × height, A = 2·base + lateral)
    - All dimensions provided, single-step calculations
  medium:
    - Cylinders with dimensions up to 30, requiring circle formula application
    - One missing dimension requiring formula rearrangement
    - Multi-step problems combining surface area and volume
  hard:
    - Composite solids combining multiple prisms or prisms with cylinders
    - Problems requiring derivation or explanation of formula components
    - Optimization problems (minimizing surface area for given volume)
prerequisites:
  - grade5-volume
  - grade5-area-perimeter-advanced
real_world_context:
  - Calculating material needed for cylindrical storage tanks and silos
  - Determining capacity of shipping containers and packaging boxes
  - Planning concrete needed for rectangular or cylindrical building foundations
  - Designing product packaging to minimize material while maintaining volume
  - Calculating paint or coating needed for prism-shaped or cylindrical structures
  - Aquarium builders computing water volume for fish tank dimensions
  - Candle makers determining wax quantities for cylindrical mold sizes
  - Pool maintenance calculating chemical amounts based on pool volume
  - HVAC engineers sizing air ducts using cross-sectional area and length
  - Bakers calculating cake tin volumes for recipe scaling
  - Shipping companies determining package dimensions for freight costs
  - Juice manufacturers calculating can sizes for optimal product portions
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid pyramids, cones, and spheres (not part of Grade 8 curriculum)
  - Do not use composite solids with more than 3 components
  - Avoid decimal dimensions beyond one decimal place
  - Do not combine trigonometry with solid geometry
  - Avoid irregular or oblique prisms (keep bases perpendicular to height)
