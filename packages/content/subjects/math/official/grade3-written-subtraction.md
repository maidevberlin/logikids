# Written Subtraction

Generate a task where {{name}} performs written subtraction with multi-digit numbers, using the standard algorithm with borrowing (regrouping), appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Focus on the column method (vertical subtraction) with numbers up to 1000, including borrowing from higher place values.

Use varied approaches:

**Standard Three-Digit Subtraction:**
- Present subtraction problems requiring the column method
- Example: "Calculate $654 - 328$ using the written subtraction method."

```
  654
- 328
-----
  326
```

- Show borrowing when needed: Can't do $4 - 8$, so borrow from tens
- Vary which columns require borrowing

**Subtraction with Borrowing in Multiple Columns:**
- Create problems requiring borrowing across 2 or 3 places
- Example: "Subtract $532 - 248$"

```
  4 12
  5 3 2
- 2 4 8
-------
  2 8 4
```

- Ones: Can't do $2 - 8$, borrow from tens: $12 - 8 = 4$
- Tens: Now $2 - 4$, borrow from hundreds: $12 - 4 = 8$
- Hundreds: $4 - 2 = 2$

**Borrowing from Zero:**
- Include problems where middle digit(s) are zero
- Example: "Calculate $604 - 257$"
- Need to borrow from hundreds through the zero in tens place

```
  5 10 14
  6 0 4
- 2 5 7
-------
  3 4 7
```

**Estimation Before Calculating:**
- Ask students to estimate by rounding first
- Example: "Estimate $723 - 386$ by rounding to the nearest hundred, then calculate exactly."
- Estimate: $700 - 400 = 300$; Exact: $723 - 386 = 337$

**Checking with Addition (Inverse Operation):**
- Verify subtraction answers by adding
- Example: "Calculate $561 - 284$. Check your answer by adding."
- Answer: $277$; Check: $277 + 284 = 561$ ✓

**Real-World Word Problems:**
- Apply written subtraction to practical contexts
- Example: "A library had $845$ books. It lent out $367$ books. How many books remain?"
- Contexts: money (change), distances, inventory, temperature differences

**Three-Digit Minus Two-Digit:**
- Mix different numbers of digits
- Example: "Calculate $628 - 79$"
- Emphasize proper alignment of place values

**Finding Missing Numbers:**
- Present problems with missing digits
- Example: "Complete this subtraction: $6\_5 - 2\_8 = 367$. What are the missing digits?"

**Error Analysis:**
- Ask students to identify and correct mistakes
- Example: "Anna calculated $542 - 276 = 374$. What error did she make?"
- Common error: subtracting smaller from larger in each column without borrowing (e.g., $2 - 7 = 5$)

**Explaining the Algorithm:**
- Ask students to explain the borrowing process
- Example: "Explain why we change the $5$ to a $4$ and the $3$ to $13$ when calculating $536 - 248$."

**Multiple Step Problems:**
- Combine subtraction with other operations
- Example: "A store had $480$ apples. On Monday, $145$ were sold. On Tuesday, $98$ were sold. How many apples remain?"
- Requires two subtractions or one subtraction: $480 - (145 + 98)$

Use step-by-step worked examples showing borrowing clearly. Mark crossed-out and reduced digits when borrowing. Include LaTeX for all numbers and calculations. Vary scenarios: some with no borrowing, some with single borrowing, some with multiple/cascading borrows including from zeros.
