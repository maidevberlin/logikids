difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Standard right triangles with one angle and one side given
    - Direct application of sin, cos, or tan to find one unknown side or angle
    - Simple verification of sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 with given angle values
  medium:
    - Problems requiring choice between multiple trigonometric ratios
    - Surveying problems with clear angle of elevation or depression
    - Combining Pythagorean theorem with trigonometric ratios
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems requiring auxiliary constructions or intermediate calculations
    - Physics applications with force decomposition on inclined planes
    - Complex surveying scenarios with multiple triangles or indirect measurements
prerequisites:
  - grade7-congruence-triangles
  - grade7-proportionality
  - grade8-integer-exponents
real_world_context:
  - Surveyors measure building heights and terrain distances using angles of elevation and depression without direct measurement
  - Architects calculate roof pitch angles and rafter lengths using trigonometric ratios for construction planning
  - Navigation systems determine distances and bearings between locations using trigonometric calculations
  - Engineers analyze forces on inclined planes and ramps by decomposing forces into components using sine and cosine
  - Photographers and filmmakers calculate camera angles and lens positions to achieve desired perspectives and framing
  - Pilots calculating descent angles and runway approach paths
  - Rock climbers evaluating route steepness and rope lengths
  - Ski slope designers determining gradient percentages for trails
  - Crane operators calculating boom angles for safe lifting
  - Astronomers measuring angles to celestial objects for distance estimates
  - Stair builders calculating riser and tread dimensions for comfort
  - Wheelchair ramp designers ensuring ADA-compliant slope angles
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using angles outside the 0° to 90° range for basic right triangle problems
  - Do not apply trigonometric ratios to non-right triangles without indication
  - Avoid problems where the hypotenuse is incorrectly identified or ambiguous
  - Do not mix degrees and radians in the same problem without clear notation
  - Avoid contexts requiring calculator precision beyond two decimal places
