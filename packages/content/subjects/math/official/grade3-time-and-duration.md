name: Time and Duration
description: Reading clocks, calculating time spans, understanding calendar relationships, and working with units of time
grade: 3
focus: Time measurement and duration
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Read analog and digital clocks accurately to the minute
  - Calculate time spans and durations within a day
  - Understand relationships between seconds, minutes, and hours
  - Use calendar knowledge to solve problems involving days, weeks, and months
  - Convert between different units of time (minutes to hours, days to weeks)
  - Determine elapsed time between two given times
problem_types:
  - Clock reading
  - Time span calculation
  - Unit conversion
  - Calendar problems
  - Elapsed time
  - Time comparison
  - Schedule planning
  - Duration estimation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Read times to the nearest 5 minutes on analog or digital clocks
    - Calculate simple time spans within one hour
    - Convert between hours and minutes using whole numbers
  medium:
    - Read times to the exact minute on both clock types
    - Calculate time spans crossing the hour boundary
    - Solve calendar problems involving weeks and months
  hard:
    - Calculate complex time spans crossing multiple hours or days
    - Convert between multiple time units in multi-step problems
    - Solve scheduling problems with multiple time constraints
prerequisites:
  - grade2-measurement-skills
  - grade3-written-addition-and-subtraction
real_world_context:
  - Planning daily schedules and knowing when activities start and end
  - Understanding how long tasks take and managing time for homework or play
  - Reading bus or train schedules to arrive at destinations on time
  - Calculating cooking or baking times using timers and clocks
  - Understanding age differences and birthdays using calendar knowledge
  - A movie theater manager scheduling film start and end times

  - Timing laps during a swimming or running practice session
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using 24-hour clock notation (use 12-hour AM/PM format)
  - Don't include time zones or daylight saving time concepts
  - Avoid durations longer than one week unless specifically calendar-focused
  - Don't use decimal time notation (use hours and minutes separately)
  - Avoid problems requiring knowledge of leap years or historical dates
