id: grade8-fractional-equations
name: Fractional Equations
description: Solving equations with algebraic fractions, checking for extraneous solutions, and rearranging formulas in scientific contexts
grade: 8
focus: Equation solving with rational expressions
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Solve fractional equations by clearing denominators
  - Interpret fractional equations as intersection problems of rational functions
  - Identify and check for extraneous solutions from domain restrictions
  - Rearrange scientific formulas for specific variables
  - Apply fractional equation solving to physics and chemistry formulas
problem_types:
  - Simple fraction equation
  - Multiple fractions equation
  - Formula rearrangement
  - Extraneous solution check
  - Physics formula solving
  - Proportion equation
  - Mixed term equation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single fraction per side, linear numerators and denominators
    - Denominators are simple binomials or constants
    - At most one extraneous solution to check
  medium:
    - Multiple fractions requiring common denominator
    - Denominators up to degree 2
    - Real-world formulas with 3-4 variables
  hard:
    - Multiple fractions on both sides of the equation
    - Mixed polynomial and fractional terms
    - Complex scientific formulas requiring multiple rearrangement steps
prerequisites:
  - grade8-fractional-terms
  - grade7-linear-equations
real_world_context:
  - Physics formulas relate resistance, voltage, and current in electrical circuits
  - Chemistry formulas calculate concentration from mass and volume relationships
  - Optics formulas connect focal length, object distance, and image distance in lenses
  - Average speed calculations involve distance and time in fractional relationships
  - Economic formulas determine unit prices and total costs with variable quantities
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid equations requiring quadratic formula or factoring beyond linear terms
  - Don't introduce rational functions with polynomial numerators of degree > 1
  - Avoid systems of fractional equations
  - Don't use denominators that factor into more than 2 distinct terms
  - Avoid formulas from advanced physics topics unfamiliar to 14-year-olds
