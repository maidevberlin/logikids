name: Scale and Maps
description: Reading and creating floor plans and maps; understanding scale as a ratio; calculating real distances from map distances; spatial orientation and direction
grade: 4
focus: Scale, maps, and spatial representation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Read and interpret simple floor plans and maps
  - Understand scale as the relationship between map distance and real distance
  - Use simple scales (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) to calculate real distances from map measurements
  - Create simple floor plans of familiar spaces with appropriate scale
  - Describe position and direction using maps and cardinal directions
  - Enlarge and reduce simple shapes by a given whole-number factor
  - Connect 2D representations (floor plans) with 3D reality (actual spaces)
problem_types:
  - Floor plan reading
  - Real distance calculation
  - Map distance calculation
  - Scale identification
  - Floor plan creation
  - Shape enlargement
  - Shape reduction
  - Direction description
  - Position finding
  - Scale comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Scale 1:10 with simple whole numbers and direct conversions
    - Reading simple floor plans to identify rooms or objects
    - Enlarging shapes by factor 2 or 3 on a grid
  medium:
    - Scale 1:100 with two-step calculations involving unit conversion
    - Creating simple floor plans with given scale
    - Calculating distances using scale and comparing multiple measurements
  hard:
    - Scale 1:1000 or mixed scales in one problem
    - Multi-step problems combining scale calculation with comparison or decision-making
    - Reducing shapes by non-trivial factors or working backward from real to map size
prerequisites:
  - grade4-measurement-units
  - grade4-geometry-spatial
real_world_context:
  - Reading floor plans of your classroom or home to find where furniture fits
  - Using town maps to find distances between locations like school, park, and library
  - Understanding building plans when helping parents plan room layouts
  - Reading treasure maps or game boards that show scaled-down versions of real spaces
  - Using enlargement when copying drawings or patterns to a bigger size
  - A theme park visitor using maps to plan which rides to visit
  - Creating model railway layouts with scaled buildings
  - An interior designer presenting room arrangements to clients
  - Planning hiking routes using trail maps with distance scales
  - Understanding zoo maps to find animal exhibits
  - A toy designer creating miniature versions of real vehicles
  - Reading stadium seating charts to find assigned seats
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid non-whole-number scales like 1:250 or 1:50000
  - Don't use complex map symbols beyond basic labels and shapes
  - Avoid diagonal measurements or Pythagorean theorem calculations
  - Don't require compass use or precise angle measurements for directions
  - Avoid mixing different units in scale ratios (e.g., cm to m without conversion)
