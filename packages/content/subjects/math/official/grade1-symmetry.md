id: grade1-symmetry
name: Symmetry
description: Recognizing axial symmetry through folding and mirror activities, identifying symmetric shapes, and creating symmetric patterns
grade: 1
focus: Geometry and spatial reasoning
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Identify shapes and figures that have symmetry
  - Find the line of symmetry in simple shapes and pictures
  - Determine if a shape is symmetric by imagining folding it in half
  - Recognize symmetric patterns in the environment and everyday objects
  - Complete the missing half of a symmetric figure
problem_types:
  - Symmetry identification
  - Line of symmetry finding
  - Symmetric or not symmetric
  - Pattern completion
  - Mirror image matching
  - Folding prediction
  - Real-world symmetry recognition
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple shapes with vertical line of symmetry (butterfly, heart)
    - Clear visual differences between symmetric and non-symmetric options
    - One line of symmetry only
  medium:
    - Shapes with horizontal or vertical line of symmetry
    - Complete half of a simple symmetric figure
    - Identify symmetry in less obvious everyday objects
  hard:
    - Determine where the line of symmetry would be in complex figures
    - Multiple choice with similar but not identical mirror halves
    - Predict what a folded and cut paper would look like when unfolded
real_world_context:
  - Butterfly wings are symmetric with a line down the middle
  - Many leaves have a symmetric shape with the stem as the line of symmetry
  - Human faces are approximately symmetric with the nose as the center line
  - Buildings and windows often have symmetric designs
  - Folded paper crafts like paper hearts and snowflakes use symmetry
  - A royal crown with jewels arranged symmetrically on both sides
  - Kites flying in the sky have symmetric shapes for balance
  - Ladybugs and other insects have symmetric patterns on their wings
  - Masks for carnival or theater often have symmetric decorations
  - Reflection in a lake shows symmetric images of trees and mountains
  - Traditional folk costumes with symmetric embroidery patterns
  - Christmas trees decorated symmetrically with ornaments on both sides
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid shapes with multiple lines of symmetry (too complex for grade 1)
  - Don't use diagonal lines of symmetry
  - Avoid rotational symmetry concepts
  - Don't require precise drawing or measuring
  - Avoid abstract shapes unfamiliar to 6-7 year olds
