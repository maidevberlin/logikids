# Algebraic Thinking

Generate tasks that help students develop early algebraic reasoning through patterns, structures, equations, and number relationships. Focus on building conceptual understanding of mathematical operations, unknown values, and systematic thinking.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse problem types that test algebraic thinking from multiple angles:

1. **Order of Operations Application**: Present expressions with multiple operations requiring systematic evaluation following correct precedence rules (parentheses, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction)

2. **Equation Solving**: Provide simple equations with one unknown value where students find missing numbers through inverse operations or logical reasoning

3. **Pattern Recognition and Extension**: Show numeric or geometric sequences where students identify rules and predict next elements or missing values

4. **Divisibility Analysis**: Ask students to determine divisibility by specific numbers, classify numbers as divisible/not divisible, or find all numbers in a range meeting certain divisibility criteria

5. **Prime vs Composite Classification**: Present numbers for students to identify as prime or composite, explain reasoning, or find all primes/composites in a range

6. **Factor and Multiple Exploration**: Challenge students to find all factors of a number, identify common factors, find multiples, or determine relationships between numbers based on factors/multiples

7. **Functional Relationship Discovery**: Provide input-output tables or real-world scenarios where students identify patterns, describe relationships in words, or predict missing values

8. **Variable Introduction**: Present situations with unknown quantities represented by symbols or letters, where students determine values or write expressions

9. **Comparison and Reasoning**: Ask students to compare expressions without calculating, determine which is greater/smaller, or explain why using properties of operations

10. **Real-World Problem Modeling**: Describe situations requiring algebraic thinking (sharing equally, organizing objects, planning schedules) where students set up and solve equations or apply divisibility concepts

## Age-Based Complexity

Adjust cognitive demands based on student age using {{age}}:

**Younger students ({{age}} = 9):**
- Focus on concrete examples with smaller numbers
- Emphasize visual representations and manipulatives
- Use simple one-step problems
- Introduce basic patterns with clear repetition
- Work with divisibility for 2, 5, and 10 first
- Present equations as "finding the missing number"
- Use everyday contexts (sharing toys, organizing items)

**Older students ({{age}} = 10):**
- Increase to larger numbers and multi-step problems
- Include all divisibility rules (2, 3, 5, 10)
- Introduce formal equation notation with variables
- Present more complex patterns requiring deeper analysis
- Combine multiple concepts (factors AND divisibility)
- Use abstract reasoning alongside concrete examples
- Present scenarios requiring planning and strategic thinking

## Difficulty Scaling

Vary task complexity based on {{difficulty}}:

**Easy:**
- Direct application of single concepts
- Small numbers with obvious patterns
- Clear step-by-step guidance provided
- Single divisibility rule at a time
- Finding factors of numbers under 30
- Simple equations with one operation
- Explicit pattern rules stated

**Medium:**
- Combining two concepts in one problem
- Moderate-sized numbers requiring calculation
- Multiple-step solution processes
- Applying several divisibility rules
- Finding factors and multiples of numbers up to 100
- Equations requiring two operations
- Pattern rules that must be discovered

**Hard:**
- Complex problems integrating three or more concepts
- Large numbers demanding strategic thinking
- Multi-step reasoning with explanation required
- Justifying divisibility without division
- Finding prime factorization or greatest common factors
- Equations with multiple unknowns or complex structures
- Hidden patterns requiring systematic investigation

## Numerical Value Variation

Vary numbers systematically to prevent repetition (describe principles, not specific examples):

- **Order of magnitude diversity**: Use single-digit, double-digit, and triple-digit numbers across different tasks
- **Divisibility variety**: Ensure numbers test different divisibility rules (some divisible by one criterion, some by multiple, some by none)
- **Prime distribution**: Include various primes (small, large, near boundaries), composites with few factors, and highly composite numbers
- **Meaningful ranges**: Select numbers appropriate for grade level (generally under 1000) but vary significantly within that range
- **Contextual appropriateness**: Match number size to real-world context (reasonable quantities for sharing, organizing, measuring)

## Format Guidance

Specify appropriate presentation formats based on problem type:

**Use tables when:**
- Showing input-output relationships for functions
- Organizing factor pairs or multiples
- Comparing multiple numbers for divisibility
- Displaying pattern sequences with multiple attributes

**Use visual representations when:**
- Illustrating equal groupings for division concepts
- Showing rectangular arrays for factor pairs
- Depicting geometric patterns
- Representing unknowns in equations with pictures or boxes

**Use number lines when:**
- Showing sequences and skip counting
- Illustrating multiples of numbers
- Demonstrating interval patterns

**Use written expressions when:**
- Presenting order of operations problems
- Showing equations with variables
- Describing functional relationships algebraically

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do NOT create tasks that:

- Repeat identical number combinations across multiple generated tasks
- Use only even numbers or only multiples of 5 (vary unpredictably)
- Present equations in the exact same format repeatedly (vary structure: ___ + 5 = 12 vs 7 + ___ = 12 vs 3 × ___ = 15)
- Test only memorization of divisibility rules without application
- Focus exclusively on computation without reasoning
- Use overly artificial contexts that don't connect to student experience
- Present patterns so obvious they require no thinking
- Ask for factors without specifying complete list, pairs, or other clear requirements

## Variable Substitution Notes

When generating tasks, the system provides:
- {{age}}: Student age (9-10 for grade 4)
- {{difficulty}}: Task difficulty (easy/medium/hard)
- {{gender}}: Student gender preference for characters
- Additional context variations handled by backend variation system

Use these to customize:
- Problem complexity and number size
- Scaffolding and hint detail level
- Character names and scenarios
- Vocabulary and explanation depth
