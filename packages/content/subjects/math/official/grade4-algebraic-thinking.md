focus: Patterns, structures, and early algebraic reasoning
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Evaluate expressions using order of operations
  - Solve simple equations with unknown values
  - Apply divisibility rules for 2, 3, 5, and 10

  - Find factors and multiples of numbers
  - Recognize and describe functional relationships
prerequisites:
  - grade3-multiplication-with-large-numbers
  - grade3-division-with-remainder
  - grade3-laws-of-arithmetic
real_world_context: Algebraic thinking helps students organize calculations systematically, solve real-world problems involving unknown quantities, recognize patterns in nature and daily life, and develop logical reasoning skills essential for advanced mathematics
problem_types:
  - order of operations
  - equation solving
  - pattern recognition
  - divisibility analysis
  - prime vs composite
  - factors and multiples
  - functional relationships
  - variable introduction
  - comparison reasoning
  - problem modeling
age_guidelines:
  9:
    - Focus on concrete examples with smaller numbers
    - Emphasize visual representations and manipulatives
    - Use simple one-step problems
    - Introduce basic patterns with clear repetition
    - Work with divisibility for 2, 5, and 10 first
    - Present equations as "finding the missing number"
    - Use everyday contexts (sharing toys, organizing items)
  10:
    - Increase to larger numbers and multi-step problems
    - Include all divisibility rules (2, 3, 5, 10)
    - Introduce formal equation notation with variables
    - Present more complex patterns requiring deeper analysis
    - Combine multiple concepts (factors AND divisibility)
    - Use abstract reasoning alongside concrete examples
    - Present scenarios requiring planning and strategic thinking
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct application of single concepts
    - Small numbers with obvious patterns
    - Clear step-by-step guidance provided
    - Single divisibility rule at a time
    - Finding factors of numbers under 30
    - Simple equations with one operation
    - Explicit pattern rules stated
  medium:
    - Combining two concepts in one problem
    - Moderate-sized numbers requiring calculation
    - Multiple-step solution processes
    - Applying several divisibility rules
    - Finding factors and multiples of numbers up to 100
    - Equations requiring two operations
    - Pattern rules that must be discovered
  hard:
    - Complex problems integrating three or more concepts
    - Large numbers demanding strategic thinking
    - Multi-step reasoning with explanation required
    - Justifying divisibility without division
    - Finding prime factorization or greatest common factors
    - Equations with multiple unknowns or complex structures
    - Hidden patterns requiring systematic investigation
