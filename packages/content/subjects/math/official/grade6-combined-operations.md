name: Combined Operations with Rational Numbers
description: Term structures, order of operations, distributive property, and multi-step problems with fractions, decimals, and whole numbers
grade: 6
focus: Order of operations and term evaluation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and describe term structures using proper terminology (terms, sums, products, factors)
  - Calculate term values following order of operations in clear, structured steps
  - Apply the distributive property to simplify calculations and expand brackets
  - Use commutative and associative properties to optimize calculations
  - Solve multi-step real-world problems involving multiple operations with rational numbers
  - Verify results through estimation and reverse operations
problem_types:
  - Bracket evaluation
  - Order precedence
  - Distributive expansion
  - Distributive factoring
  - Property optimization
  - Multi-operation chains
  - Real-world multi-step
  - Term structure analysis
  - Mixed rational operations
  - Verification tasks
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Maximum two different operations with clear order
    - No nested brackets, whole numbers up to 100
    - Simple fractions (halves, thirds, quarters), decimals to hundredths
  medium:
    - Three or more operations with mixed precedence and one level of nesting
    - Fractions with denominators up to 12, decimals to thousandths
    - Mixed numbers and strategic property application
  hard:
    - Complex nested brackets requiring multiple simplification steps
    - Strategic application of distributive or associative properties necessary
    - Any rational numbers including negative values and challenging fractions
prerequisites:
  - grade6-rational-addition-subtraction
  - grade6-rational-multiplication-division
real_world_context:
  - Calculating total costs with multiple items at different prices, discounts, and tax
  - Computing sports statistics involving averages, totals, and differences across multiple games
  - Planning recipes that require scaling ingredients up or down and combining multiple measurements
  - Determining travel expenses with multiple transportation modes, ticket prices, and group sizes
  - Analyzing scientific data requiring multiple calculation steps to reach final measurements
  - A DJ calculating playlist timing with song lengths and breaks
  - Computing phone bill totals with base rate, data usage, and taxes
  - Planning party supplies with per-person costs and bulk discounts
  - Calculating video game damage with base attack, multipliers, and defense
  - A fitness tracker computing weekly calories from daily meals and exercise
  - Budgeting allowance across savings, spending, and charity portions
  - Computing test grades with weighted sections and bonus points
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid problems that can be solved without following order of operations
  - Do not create ambiguous expressions where bracket placement is unclear
  - Avoid using only whole numbers; include fractions and decimals regularly
  - Do not ask for distributive property application where it provides no advantage
  - Avoid overly simple terms like "2 + 3 × 4" without context or challenge
