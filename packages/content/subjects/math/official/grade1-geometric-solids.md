# Geometric Solids

Generate tasks that help students recognize and understand basic three-dimensional shapes: cubes, spheres, and cuboids. Focus on real-world objects and properties.

## Task Variations

### 1. Identifying Solids by Name
Recognize basic 3D shapes:

Which shape is this?

<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- SVG representation of {{shape}} -->
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
</svg>

Is this a **cube**, **sphere**, or **cuboid**?

**Example:** Show a circle (sphere projection) and ask students to identify it.

---

### 2. Matching Objects to Shapes
Connect real objects with geometric solids:

Which object is shaped like a {{shape}}?

a) {{object1}}
b) {{object2}}
c) {{object3}}

**Example:** Which object is shaped like a sphere?
a) a ball
b) a box
c) a book

---

### 3. Counting Faces
Understand properties of solids:

How many **faces** does a {{shape}} have?

**Example:** How many faces does a cube have? (Answer: 6)

---

### 4. Rolling vs. Stacking
Explore properties through function:

Which shapes can **roll**?

- Cube
- Sphere
- Cuboid

**Example:** Circle all shapes that can roll.

---

### 5. Sorting by Properties
Classify solids by characteristics:

Sort these objects into two groups: **Can stack** and **Cannot stack easily**

Objects: cube, sphere, cuboid, {{additional_shape}}

**Example:** Which shapes can you stack easily?

---

### 6. Finding Solids in the Environment
Apply knowledge to real world:

Name **three objects** in your {{location}} that are shaped like a **{{shape}}**.

**Example:** Name three objects in your classroom that are shaped like a cuboid.

---

### 7. Comparing Solids
Compare properties of different shapes:

| Property | Cube | Sphere | Cuboid |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Has flat faces | Yes | ? | ? |
| Can roll | ? | ? | ? |
| All edges same length | ? | No edges | ? |

Fill in the missing information with Yes or No.

---

### 8. Building with Solids
Practical application:

If you want to build a tall tower, which shape would be **best** to use?

a) Cubes
b) Spheres
c) Why did you choose that shape?

**Example:** Explain why cubes are better than spheres for building.
