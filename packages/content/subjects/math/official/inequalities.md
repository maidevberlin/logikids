# Linear Inequalities

Generate tasks that help students master inequalities as a natural extension of equations, develop fluency with inequality notation, and understand how inequalities model real constraints and conditions. Tasks should emphasize the meaning of inequality symbols, the impact of operations (especially multiplication/division by negatives), solution representation on number lines, and practical applications.

## Problem Type Variations

Create diverse task structures:

1. **Inequality Symbol Meaning**: Identify which inequality symbol (<, >, ≤, ≥) correctly describes given relationships, translate verbal statements into inequality notation
2. **Number Line Representation**: Plot solution sets on number lines, identify whether to use open or closed circles, write inequality from a number line diagram
3. **Simple Inequality Solving**: Solve inequalities using addition/subtraction (e.g., $x + 5 > 12$, $x - 3 \leq 7$)
4. **Solving with Multiplication/Division**: Solve inequalities involving positive multipliers/divisors (e.g., $3x < 15$, $\frac{x}{2} \geq 4$)
5. **Solving with Negative Multipliers/Division**: Solve inequalities requiring sign reversal (e.g., $-2x > 8$, $\frac{-x}{3} \leq 5$), explicitly explain why the inequality flips
6. **Multi-Step Inequalities**: Combine addition/subtraction with multiplication/division (e.g., $2x + 3 < 11$, $\frac{x-4}{2} \geq 3$)
7. **Solution Set Verification**: Given an inequality and several test values, determine which satisfy the inequality and explain why
8. **Writing Inequalities from Context**: Given a real-world scenario with constraints, write an appropriate inequality
9. **Comparing Inequalities**: Determine if two inequalities have the same solution set, order solution sets by size
10. **Boundary Value Analysis**: Identify the boundary value of an inequality, test values near the boundary to understand the solution set
11. **Inequalities with Fractions**: Solve inequalities involving rational coefficients (e.g., $\frac{2}{3}x \geq 4$, $x + \frac{1}{2} < 3$)
12. **Strict vs. Non-Strict**: Distinguish between < / > (strict, open circle) and ≤ / ≥ (non-strict, closed circle) in problem context
13. **Real-World Constraint Modeling**: Model speed limits, age requirements, budget limits, or other practical constraints with inequalities
14. **Inequality Application**: Use inequality to find acceptable ranges of values in context (e.g., "How many items can I buy with my budget?")

## Age-Based Scaffolding

Adapt complexity based on student age and development:

**For younger students ({{age}} < 13):**
- Use concrete number line representations with clear visual supports
- Start with inequalities solvable by addition/subtraction only
- Use integer coefficients and integer solutions initially
- Emphasize the visual meaning of inequality symbols through comparison activities
- Use abundant real-world contexts (age limits, height restrictions, score minimums)
- Avoid multiplication/division by negatives initially; introduce gradually
- Include visual scaffolding showing how to translate words to symbols
- Focus on understanding what the solution set means rather than algebraic mechanics

**For older students ({{age}} >= 13):**
- Progress to inequalities with all four operations
- Include problems requiring sign reversal (negative multipliers/divisors)
- Work with rational coefficients and solutions
- Require written explanation of the sign reversal rule and why it works
- Include multi-step problems requiring planning and strategic thinking
- Connect inequalities to linear equations and introduce concepts of linear programming contexts
- Include problems with fractions and decimals
- Require verification and justification of solutions using algebraic reasoning
- Introduce discussion of why we flip the inequality when multiplying/dividing by negatives

## Difficulty Scaling

Adjust problem complexity based on difficulty level:

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = 'easy'):**
- Inequalities solvable by single operations: addition or subtraction only
- Use small integers (roughly -20 to 20)
- Integer solutions with clear number line representations
- Clear, straightforward real-world contexts with obvious constraints
- Simple substitution checks (values near the boundary)
- Mostly familiar inequality symbols with explicit meaning stated
- Single-step solution process
- Closed circle or open circle, clearly indicated

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = 'medium'):**
- Two-step inequalities (e.g., $2x + 5 < 11$)
- Work with integers from approximately -50 to 50
- Introduce multiplication/division by positive numbers first
- Include at least one problem with sign reversal (multiplying/dividing by negative)
- Solution sets represented as $x < a$, $x \leq b$, etc.
- Real-world contexts with moderate complexity
- Require number line representation of solution sets
- Test boundary values to verify solutions
- Explain when and why to use open vs. closed circles
- Verify one or two test points from the solution set

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = 'hard'):**
- Three or more step inequalities with mixed operations
- Work with rational coefficients and negative numbers throughout
- Multiple problems requiring sign reversal (various negative multipliers/divisors)
- Solution sets with complex expressions (e.g., $x \geq -\frac{3}{4}$)
- Abstract real-world scenarios requiring problem translation and planning
- Compound inequalities or inequalities requiring reasoning about multiple constraints
- Require algebraic justification for each step and explanation of sign reversal
- Problems comparing solution sets or determining if solutions overlap
- Work with fractions and decimals in coefficients and constants
- Verify multiple test points and explain why the solution set is correct

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Generate diverse numbers and combinations following these principles:

- **Coefficient variety**: Use positive and negative integers, fractions, and simple decimals as coefficients
- **Constant variety**: Mix positive and negative constants; avoid repetitive patterns
- **Operation mix**: Vary which operations appear (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Sign reversal distribution**: Include problems where students must and must not reverse the inequality
- **Boundary values**: Sometimes solutions are positive, sometimes negative, sometimes zero is involved
- **Realistic scales**: Use age-appropriate constraints (ages 0-100, temperatures -50°C to 50°C, budgets in reasonable ranges)
- **Context alignment**: Ensure numbers match their real-world meaning (heights in cm, prices in currency, times in hours)
- **Solution diversity**: Generate inequalities with different solution set sizes (very restrictive, moderate, very open)
- **Fraction inclusion**: When appropriate for the level, include simple fractions ($\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}$)

## Answer Format and Verification

**For solution set problems:**
- Write solution using inequality notation: $x > 5$, $x \leq -3$, $x \geq 0$, etc.
- Draw or describe number line representation with correct circle type (open or closed)
- For multiple-choice, clearly identify the correct inequality and reasoning

**For algebraic solutions:**
- Show step-by-step work with one operation per line
- At each step, write the inequality with all variables and operations
- When multiplying/dividing by a negative, explicitly note that the inequality reverses
- Box or highlight the final answer in inequality notation

**For verification:**
- Test at least one value from the solution set (should satisfy the original inequality)
- Test the boundary value (should either satisfy or not, depending on strict vs. non-strict)
- Test a value outside the solution set (should not satisfy the original inequality)
- Show substitution and verification in the original inequality

**For real-world problems:**
- Write the inequality that models the constraint
- Solve the inequality algebraically
- Interpret the solution in context with appropriate units and language
- Verify that the answer makes sense in the real-world situation

**Verification strategies to include:**
- Substitution of boundary values to check < vs. ≤ and > vs. ≥
- Testing values from inside and outside the solution set
- Checking that algebraic steps reverse the inequality when appropriate
- Confirming that the final answer makes sense in context

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design some tasks to specifically challenge these typical errors:

- Forgetting to reverse the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative number (e.g., solving $-2x > 6$ as $x > -3$ instead of $x < -3$)
- Confusing inequality symbols or misinterpreting which direction the "mouth" opens
- Using the wrong circle type on a number line (open for ≤/≥, closed for </>, which is reversed)
- Solving inequalities as if they were equations, forgetting that inequalities have solution sets not single answers
- Incorrectly applying inverse operations (e.g., subtracting 5 from both sides when 5 was added)
- Not understanding that an inequality can be equivalent to its opposite (e.g., $x > 3$ is the same as $3 < x$)
- Misrepresenting solution sets on number lines (arrow direction incorrect, or endpoints not marked)
- In real-world problems, choosing the wrong inequality direction based on the context words
- Testing only one point to verify a solution when multiple boundaries exist
- Not simplifying the solution to standard form (e.g., leaving $-x < 5$ instead of $x > -5$)
- Thinking that every inequality has an integer solution
- Reversing inequality when they shouldn't (e.g., reversing when dividing by a positive number)

## Contextual Diversity

Use varied real-world contexts appropriate for middle school students:

- **Safety Regulations**: Speed limits (≤ maximum), height restrictions for rides (≥ minimum), weight limits (≤ maximum), age restrictions (≥ minimum age for entry)
- **Financial**: Budget constraints (≤ maximum spending), savings goals (≥ minimum amount), discount thresholds (spend ≥ amount for discount), credit limits (≤ card limit)
- **Health and Fitness**: Heart rate zones (≥ minimum and ≤ maximum), sleep requirements (≥ minimum hours), water intake goals (≥ minimum liters)
- **Academics**: Grading (≥ passing score), class attendance (≥ minimum percentage), homework completion (≥ required number)
- **Environmental**: Temperature ranges (weather forecasts), rainfall patterns (above/below normal), pollution levels (safe limits)
- **Time and Scheduling**: Appointment windows (available from 2 PM ≤ time ≤ 5 PM), deadlines (≤ final submission time), availability periods
- **Games and Competitions**: Point thresholds to advance, scoring ranges (minimum and maximum possible), tie-breaking rules

Ensure contexts are:
- Age-appropriate and relevant to student interests
- Realistic in terms of numbers and situations
- Culturally neutral and inclusive
- Meaningful for understanding why inequalities matter in decision-making

## Visual Representation

**When to use visual supports:**
- Number line: For representing solution sets, showing open/closed circles, comparing inequalities, understanding direction
- Real-world diagrams: Speedometer, thermometer, weight scale, ruler (marked with minimum/maximum)
- Arrow diagrams: Showing direction and range of acceptable values
- Inequality timeline: For time-based constraints
- Table: Comparing multiple inequalities or showing test values and whether they work

**Avoid:**
- Do not show worked examples with specific numbers that could be copied
- Do not include complete solution steps that students could memorize without understanding
- Do not use overly decorative visuals that distract from the mathematics
- Do not assume students know which direction to shade on a number line without explicit instruction
- Describe visual formats and strategies rather than providing complete diagrams

## Key Instructional Emphasis

Tasks should reinforce these fundamental understandings:

- Inequalities represent ranges of values, not just single solutions like equations do
- Inequality symbols have consistent meaning: < means "less than," > means "greater than," ≤ includes the value, ≥ includes the value
- The direction of inequality can be reversed by reading it backward (x > 3 is the same as 3 < x)
- When multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must reverse to keep the relationship true
- Solution sets are represented as regions on a number line, with open circles for strict inequalities (< , >) and closed circles for non-strict (≤ , ≥)
- Inequalities model real-world constraints where there are acceptable ranges rather than exact values
- Solving inequalities uses the same inverse operations as solving equations, with the additional rule about reversing when using negative multipliers/divisors
- Verification in inequalities means checking that values in the solution set satisfy the original inequality
- The boundary value (where the inequality becomes an equality) is a critical reference point for understanding solutions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not create tasks that:
- Provide complete worked solutions that could be memorized without understanding
- Skip the conceptual understanding of what inequalities represent
- Use contexts so abstract that students can't connect to real meaning
- Present all problems in the same format or structure
- Neglect to include the sign reversal concept or treat it as an arbitrary rule
- Use unrealistic numbers or contexts that don't match student experience
- Focus exclusively on algebraic mechanics without connecting to number line representation
- Fail to distinguish between < / > and ≤ / ≥ or their representations
- Include multi-step problems that are so complex they obscure the inequality concept
- Present inequalities without requiring explanation or verification
- Treat all inequalities the same way regardless of the operations involved
- Neglect real-world applications where inequalities naturally represent decision-making constraints
