grade: 6
ages:
  - 11

focus: Measurement and Geometric Calculation (Größen und Messen / Flächenberechnung)
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Calculate areas of triangles using the formula A = ½ × base × height
  - Calculate areas of parallelograms and trapezoids using appropriate formulas
  - Decompose composite shapes into simpler component shapes for area calculation
  - Apply area formulas to composite figures made of multiple shape types
  - Solve multi-step word problems involving areas of complex shapes
  - Verify calculations using multiple methods and check for reasonableness
  - Convert between area units when solving composite shape problems
  - Apply strategies for finding missing measurements in composite figures
  - Understand the relationship between base, height, and area across different shape types
  - Justify solutions and explain decomposition strategies
prerequisites:
  - area-perimeter
  - geometric-shapes-2d
real_world_context: Calculating areas of composite shapes is essential in architecture and construction (calculating floor plans, building footprints, roof areas), interior design (room layouts, wall paintings, tiling patterns), agriculture (field shapes, garden plots), landscaping (yard design, pathway areas), engineering (mechanical components, structural design), and mapmaking (geographic regions, property boundaries). Grade 6 students encounter composite shapes when calculating real areas that rarely fit simple rectangular patterns. Mastery of composite shape decomposition develops spatial visualization and problem-solving skills crucial for advanced mathematics including geometry, algebra, and later trigonometry.
problem_types:
  - direct calculation

age_guidelines:
  11:
    - Introduce triangle formula through concrete exploration (cutting rectangles, folding)
    - Use clear diagrams showing base and height relationships
    - Focus initially on right triangles before introducing non-right triangles
    - Simple composite shapes with two or three obvious component parts
    - Whole number dimensions primarily, familiar units (cm, m)
    - Provide visual decomposition guidance (color-coded sections)
    - Single composite shapes before mixed problem types
    - Emphasize conceptual understanding of why decomposition works
    - Simpler real-world contexts (classrooms, gardens, simple building shapes)
  12:
    - Develop fluency with all formulas (triangle, parallelogram, trapezoid)
    - Include abstract explorations of base-height relationships
    - Non-right triangles, various parallelogram orientations
    - Complex composite shapes requiring strategic planning
    - Decimal and fractional dimensions where appropriate
    - Less detailed visual guidance; rely on description and spatial visualization
