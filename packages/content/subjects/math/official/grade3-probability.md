# Probability

Generate tasks that help students compare chances, identify fair and unfair games, and conduct simple probability experiments.

## Task Variations

### 1. Comparing Likelihood
Determine which outcomes are more or less likely:
- **Simple Comparison**: "Which is more likely: {{event1}} or {{event2}}?"
- **Certain/Impossible**: "Is {{event}} certain, likely, unlikely, or impossible?"
- **Most/Least Likely**: "Which outcome is most likely? Least likely? Why?"

Likelihood vocabulary:
- **Impossible**: Cannot happen (rolling a 7 on a normal die)
- **Unlikely**: Probably won't happen (rain in the desert)
- **Equally Likely**: Same chance (heads or tails on fair coin)
- **Likely**: Probably will happen (picking a red marble from mostly red bag)
- **Certain**: Must happen (day follows night)

Examples:
- Bag: 8 red, 2 blue marbles → Red is more likely (8 out of 10 vs. 2 out of 10)
- Spinner: 3 sections red, 1 section blue → Red is more likely

### 2. Fair vs. Unfair Games
Analyze whether games give equal chances:
- **Game Analysis**: "Two players use this {{game_device}}. Player A wins if {{condition1}}, Player B wins if {{condition2}}. Is this fair?"
- **Making Fair**: "This game is unfair. How can you change the rules to make it fair?"
- **Explain Fairness**: "Why is this game fair/unfair?"

Examples:
- **Fair**: Die numbered 1-6. Player A wins on 1,2,3. Player B wins on 4,5,6 (each has 3/6 chance)
- **Unfair**: Die numbered 1-6. Player A wins on even (2,4,6). Player B wins on 1 only (A has 3/6, B has 1/6)

### 3. Probability with Spinners
Work with circular probability models:
- **Describe Chances**: "This spinner has {{num_sections}} equal sections: {{colors}}. What is the chance of landing on {{color}}?"
- **Unequal Sections**: "Spinner has 1 large red section and 3 small blue sections. Which color is more likely?"
- **Design Spinner**: "Create a spinner where {{color1}} is twice as likely as {{color2}}"

Example spinner (4 equal sections):
- 2 red, 1 blue, 1 green
- Red: $\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ (most likely)
- Blue: $\frac{1}{4}$
- Green: $\frac{1}{4}$

### 4. Probability with Bags/Containers
Determine chances of drawing objects:
- **Simple Draw**: "Bag has {{num1}} {{color1}} and {{num2}} {{color2}} marbles. Which color is more likely? How many times more likely?"
- **Multiple Colors**: "Container has {{distribution}}. Order the colors from most to least likely"
- **Adding Objects**: "How many {{color}} marbles should we add so all colors are equally likely?"

Examples:
- Bag: 6 red, 3 blue → Red is twice as likely ($\frac{6}{9}$ vs. $\frac{3}{9}$)
- Bag: 4 red, 4 blue, 2 green → Red and blue equally likely (both $\frac{4}{10}$), green less likely ($\frac{2}{10}$)

### 5. Conducting Simple Experiments
Plan and predict probability experiments:
- **Coin Flips**: "Flip a coin {{num}} times. Predict how many heads and tails. Then conduct the experiment"
- **Die Rolls**: "Roll a die {{num}} times. Predict how often you'll roll {{number}}. Try it!"
- **Comparing Results**: "Your results: {{actual}}. Expected: {{theoretical}}. Why might they differ?"

Expected outcomes:
- Fair coin, 10 flips → Expect about 5 heads, 5 tails (but variations are normal)
- Fair die, 12 rolls → Expect about 2 of each number (but won't be exact)

### 6. Interpreting Experiment Results
Analyze data from probability experiments:
- **Results Table**: "Class flipped coins. Results: {{data}}. What do you notice?"
- **Predictions**: "After {{num1}} trials, we got {{results}}. Predict what will happen in {{num2}} more trials"
- **Long-Term Trends**: "Why do results get closer to expected after many trials?"

| Student | Heads | Tails |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Anna    | 6     | 4     |
| Ben     | 4     | 6     |
| Carlos  | 5     | 5     |
| Total   | 15    | 15    |

"After 30 total flips, we got equal heads and tails. This matches our expectation for a fair coin."

### 7. Creating Probability Scenarios
Design situations with specified probabilities:
- **Design Game**: "Create a game where Player A has a better chance than Player B"
- **Make Collection**: "Put marbles in a bag so green is more likely than blue, but red is most likely"
- **Spinner Design**: "Draw a spinner where landing on yellow is very unlikely but not impossible"

Example:
- Marble bag for: Red most likely, blue less likely, green least likely
- Could use: 6 red, 3 blue, 1 green (total 10)

### 8. Real-World Probability Problems
Apply probability to everyday situations:
- **Weather**: "Forecast says 70% chance of rain. Is rain likely or unlikely?"
- **Games**: "In this board game, you need to roll 6 to win. Is this likely on your next turn?"
- **Random Selection**: "Teacher picks {{num}} helpers randomly from {{total}} students. What's your chance of being picked?"

Examples:
- Weather: 70% = likely (more than half)
- Die: Rolling 6 = $\frac{1}{6}$ = unlikely (1 out of 6 chances)
- Selection: 2 helpers from 20 students = $\frac{2}{20} = \frac{1}{10}$ = unlikely for any one student

## Answer Requirements

Provide solutions that:
- Use simple fraction notation when appropriate ($\frac{3}{10}$ means 3 out of 10)
- Explain likelihood in words (more likely, less likely, equally likely)
- Identify fair games as those where all players have equal chances
- Note that short experiments may not match expected results perfectly
- Include diagrams of spinners, bags with marbles, or dice when helpful
- Use tables to organize experiment results
- Explain that more trials generally give results closer to expected outcomes
