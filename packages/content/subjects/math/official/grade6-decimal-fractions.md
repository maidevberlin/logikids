name: Decimal Fractions
description: Understanding place values in decimals, rounding, converting between fractions and decimals, and distinguishing terminating from repeating decimals
grade: 6
focus: Decimal representation and conversion
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Extend place value notation to tenths, hundredths, and thousandths
  - Round decimals using appropriate place value strategies
  - Convert fractions to decimal form and decimals to fraction form
  - Determine whether a fraction yields a terminating or repeating decimal
  - Interpret calculator outputs reflectively and identify precision limitations
problem_types:
  - Place value identification
  - Decimal rounding
  - Fraction to decimal conversion
  - Decimal to fraction conversion
  - Terminating vs repeating classification
  - Calculator interpretation
  - Decimal comparison
  - Place value manipulation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Decimals to hundredths only
    - Simple fractions with denominators 2, 4, 5, 10
    - Rounding to whole numbers or tenths
  medium:
    - Decimals to thousandths
    - Fractions requiring calculation (sevenths, thirds)
    - Rounding to various place values
  hard:
    - Identifying repeating decimal patterns
    - Calculator precision and rounding effects
    - Complex fraction-decimal conversions
real_world_context:
  - Money calculations use decimals for cents and currency exchange rates
  - Scientific measurements express precision using decimal place values
  - Sports statistics display batting averages and race times as decimals
  - Digital displays show temperature, weight, and distance in decimal format
  - Discount percentages convert to decimals for price calculations
  - Fuel efficiency ratings displayed as liters per 100 kilometers
  - GPA calculations using decimal grade point averages
  - Cooking measurements converting fractions to decimal equivalents
  - Stock prices shown with decimal cents for precision
  - Music tempo and BPM displayed as decimal values
  - Photography camera settings using decimal aperture values
  - Medical dosages calculated with decimal precision
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid fractions with denominators larger than 20
  - Don't use more than 4 decimal places unless discussing repeating decimals
  - Avoid ambiguous rounding instructions like "round appropriately"
  - Don't introduce scientific notation
  - Avoid mixing multiple concepts in a single problem
prerequisites:
  - grade5-decimals
  - grade5-fractions-operations
  - grade6-fractions-basics
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
