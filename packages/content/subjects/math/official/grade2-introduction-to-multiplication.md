# Introduction to Multiplication Tasks

Create problems that help students understand multiplication as repeated addition and develop fluency with basic multiplication facts.

**Vary the problem structure:**

1. **Multiplication as Repeated Addition:**
   - Convert to addition: "${{factor1}} \times {{factor2}}$ is the same as ${{factor2}} + {{factor2}} + \ldots$ ({{factor1}} times)"
   - Word problems: "{{name}} has ${{groups}}$ bags with ${{items}}$ candies each. How many candies total?"
   - Build the equation: "Write ${{num}} + {{num}} + {{num}}$ as a multiplication"

2. **Array Models (Rows and Columns):**
   - Dot arrays: "Draw ${{rows}}$ rows of ${{cols}}$ dots. How many dots in total?"
   - Visual multiplication: "This array has ${{rows}}$ rows and ${{cols}}$ columns. Write the multiplication equation."
   - Different views: "${{a}} \times {{b}}$ can be seen as ${{a}}$ groups of ${{b}}$ OR ${{b}}$ groups of ${{a}}$"

3. **Times Tables of 2:**
   - Basic facts: "${{num}} \times 2 = \text{?}$" (where {{num}} is 1-10)
   - Skip counting: "Count by 2s: $2, 4, 6, \ldots$ What is the ${{nth}}$ number?"
   - Word problems: "Bicycles have $2$ wheels each. How many wheels on ${{bikes}}$ bicycles?"
   - Missing factor: "$\text{?} \times 2 = {{product}}$"

4. **Times Tables of 5:**
   - Basic facts: "${{num}} \times 5 = \text{?}$" (where {{num}} is 1-10)
   - Skip counting: "Count by 5s: $5, 10, 15, \ldots$ Continue the pattern"
   - Word problems: "Each hand has $5$ fingers. How many fingers on ${{hands}}$ hands?"
   - Pattern observation: "What do you notice about the ones digit in the 5 times table?"

5. **Times Tables of 10:**
   - Basic facts: "${{num}} \times 10 = \text{?}$" (where {{num}} is 1-10)
   - Pattern recognition: "What happens to a number when you multiply by $10$?"
   - Word problems: "Pencils come in boxes of $10$. How many pencils in ${{boxes}}$ boxes?"
   - Inverse: "$\text{?} \times 10 = {{product}}$"

6. **Comparing Multiplication and Addition:**
   - Which is faster: "What's easier to solve: $5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5$ or $6 \times 5$?"
   - Mixed problems: "Solve both ${{num1}} + {{num1}} + {{num1}}$ and $3 \times {{num1}}$. What do you notice?"
   - Strategy selection: "When would you use multiplication instead of addition?"

7. **Commutative Property:**
   - Switch factors: "Is ${{a}} \times {{b}}$ the same as ${{b}} \times {{a}}$? Try it!"
   - Visual proof: "Draw an array for $3 \times 4$ and $4 \times 3$. What do you notice?"
   - Fact families: "If ${{a}} \times {{b}} = {{product}}$, then ${{b}} \times {{a}} = \text{?}$"

8. **Real-World Multiplication Problems:**
   - Equal groups: "There are ${{groups}}$ tables with ${{items}}$ chairs each. How many chairs total?"
   - Skip counting objects: "Count the legs on ${{num}}$ dogs (each has $4$ legs)"
   - Money problems: "Each cookie costs ${{price}}$ cents. How much for ${{count}}$ cookies?"
   - Arrays in real life: "A chocolate bar has ${{rows}}$ rows of ${{cols}}$ pieces. How many pieces total?"

**Visual representations to include:**
- Dot arrays: Use tables to show rows and columns
- Number lines for skip counting
- Groups of objects (e.g., "🔵🔵 🔵🔵 🔵🔵" for $3 \times 2$)

**Example array table:**
| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |

This shows $3 \times 5 = 15$
