name: Angle Relationships
description: Understanding angle properties at intersecting lines, with parallel lines, and in polygons
grade: 7
focus: Geometric angles and their relationships
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and calculate vertical angles (Scheitelwinkel) at intersecting lines
  - Identify and calculate supplementary angles (Nebenwinkel) at intersecting lines
  - Apply corresponding angles (Stufenwinkel) and alternate angles (Wechselwinkel) at parallel lines
  - Prove and apply the triangle angle sum theorem (180 degrees)
  - Calculate interior angle sums of polygons using the formula (n-2) × 180°
  - Determine unknown angles in complex geometric figures using multiple angle relationships
  - Verify whether lines are parallel using angle properties
problem_types:
  - Vertical angles
  - Supplementary angles
  - Corresponding angles
  - Alternate angles
  - Triangle angle sum
  - Polygon angle sum
  - Multi-step angle calculation
  - Parallel line verification
  - Angle relationship identification
  - Exterior angles
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple figures with one or two angle relationships
    - Direct application of single angle property (e.g., find vertical angle)
    - Triangles with two known angles
  medium:
    - Figures requiring two or three steps to find unknown angles
    - Polygons with 4-6 sides requiring angle sum formula
    - Problems involving both parallel lines and triangles
  hard:
    - Complex figures with multiple intersecting and parallel lines
    - Multi-step reasoning requiring combination of several angle relationships
    - Problems requiring proof that lines are parallel or perpendicular
prerequisites:
  - grade6-angles-advanced
real_world_context:
  - Architects use angle relationships to design building structures and roof angles
  - Engineers verify that construction elements are parallel by measuring corresponding angles
  - Carpenters use the triangle angle sum to create stable triangular bracing
  - Map makers rely on angle relationships to ensure accurate representations of terrain
  - Bridge designers use polygon angle properties when creating truss structures
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid problems where angles can be guessed without using angle relationships
  - Do not use polygons with more than 8 sides for angle sum calculations
  - Avoid figures where parallel lines are not clearly indicated or stated
  - Do not mix radian and degree measurements
  - Avoid terminology mixing (use either German or English terms consistently)
