grade: 7
ages:
  - 12
  - 13
focus: Angle types, complementary/supplementary/vertical angles, parallel lines with transversal
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and classify angles by type (acute, right, obtuse, straight, reflex)
  - Understand and apply complementary angle relationships (sum to 90°)
  - Understand and apply supplementary angle relationships (sum to 180°)
  - Recognize and calculate vertical angles formed by intersecting lines
  - Analyze angle relationships created by parallel lines cut by a transversal
  - Apply corresponding, alternate interior, and co-interior angle relationships
  - Solve multi-step problems using angle relationships to find unknown measures
  - Justify angle relationships using geometric properties and theorems
prerequisites:
  - geometric-shapes-2d
  - triangles-quadrilaterals
real_world_context: Architecture (roof angles, window designs, door frames), engineering (bridge supports, structural angles), surveying and navigation (angle measurements for positioning), sports (field markings, goal angles), construction (setting square angles), artistic design (pattern angles), street intersections and traffic layouts
problem_types:

age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Focus on direct angle classification and simple pair relationships

    - Emphasize visual understanding over algebraic manipulation
    - Use simple, straightforward problem structures
  13:
    - Include more complex diagram interpretation
    - Present multi-step problems where one calculated angle feeds into finding another
    - Introduce algebraic expressions for angle measures (e.g., "2x + 15")
    - Require inference about parallel line relationships
    - Ask for justification and reasoning about why relationships hold
    - Mix calculation with conceptual understanding tasks
