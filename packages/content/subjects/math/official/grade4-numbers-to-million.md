description: Understanding place value with six digits; reading, writing, comparing, and ordering numbers; rounding to thousands and beyond; recognizing patterns in large numbers
grade: 4
focus: Place value and number sense in large numbers
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand place value structure of numbers up to 1,000,000 (hundred thousands, ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, ones)
  - Read and write numbers to 1,000,000 in digits and words
  - Compare and order numbers to 1,000,000 using place value reasoning
  - Round numbers to the nearest thousand, ten thousand, or hundred thousand
  - Identify and continue patterns in large number sequences
  - Decompose and compose numbers using expanded notation
problem_types:
  - Place value identification
  - Number comparison
  - Ordering sequences
  - Rounding practice
  - Number writing
  - Expanded notation
  - Pattern completion
  - Missing digit puzzles
  - Number line estimation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Numbers 1,000-100,000 with clear place value patterns
    - Rounding to nearest thousand only
    - Simple ascending/descending sequences with constant steps
  medium:
    - Full range to 1,000,000 with mixed patterns
    - Rounding to thousands, ten thousands, and hundred thousands
    - Sequences with varying steps (not just powers of 10)
  hard:
    - Numbers near boundaries (99,998-100,002, 499,500-500,500)
    - Multi-step reasoning (compare then round, or identify pattern then continue)
    - Complex patterns with multiple rules or alternating steps
prerequisites:
  - grade3-numbers-to-1000
real_world_context:

  - Avoid ambiguous rounding without specifying target place value
  - Don't use financial contexts inappropriate for children (mortgages, salaries)
  - Avoid scientific notation or exponential representations
