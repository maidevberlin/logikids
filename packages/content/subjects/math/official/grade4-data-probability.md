id: grade4-data-probability
name: Data Analysis and Probability
description: Collecting and organizing data from surveys and experiments; creating and interpreting bar charts, pictographs, and tables; calculating simple averages; understanding likelihood and probability events
grade: 4
focus: Data representation, interpretation, and basic probability
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Collect and organize data from surveys, observations, and simple experiments
  - Create bar charts, pictographs, and tables to represent collected data
  - Read and interpret data from various graphical representations
  - Calculate the arithmetic mean (average) from small data sets
  - Identify events as certain, possible, or impossible
  - Describe likelihood of events using probability language (likely, unlikely, certain, impossible)
  - Conduct simple probability experiments with dice, coins, and spinners
problem_types:
  - Bar chart creation
  - Pictograph interpretation
  - Table organization
  - Data comparison
  - Average calculation
  - Event classification
  - Likelihood ordering
  - Probability experiment
  - Survey analysis
  - Graph reading
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Data sets with 4-6 items and values under 20
    - Bar charts and pictographs with simple 1:1 or 1:2 scales
    - Averages from 3-4 whole numbers that divide evenly; clear certain/impossible events
  medium:
    - Data sets with 6-10 items and values up to 50
    - Multiple representation types or multi-step interpretation required
    - Averages from 4-6 numbers with rounding; comparing likelihood of multiple events
  hard:
    - Data sets requiring reorganization or missing value calculation
    - Cross-referencing multiple graphs or tables for comparison
    - Averages combined with operations; designing fair/unfair probability experiments
prerequisites:
  - grade3-data-and-combinatorics
real_world_context:
  - Class surveys about favorite subjects, pets, or hobbies
  - Weather data tracking temperature or rainfall over a week or month
  - Sports statistics like goals scored, race times, or team standings
  - Probability in games using dice, spinners, or drawing cards
  - School lunch choices or attendance records over time
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid data sets larger than 12 items or values above 100
  - Don't use percentages, fractions as scale units, or decimal averages
  - Avoid complex probability requiring calculation (use qualitative language)
  - Don't mix multiple unrelated concepts in one problem
  - Avoid contexts unfamiliar to 9-10 year olds (stock markets, elections)
