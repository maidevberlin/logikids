name: Patterns and Data
description: Recognizing, continuing, and creating patterns; collecting and representing simple data
grade: 1
focus: Pattern recognition and data representation
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and describe repeating patterns using colors, shapes, or objects
  - Continue existing patterns by identifying the pattern rule
  - Create new patterns using different attributes (color, shape, size)
  - Identify errors or breaks in given patterns
  - Collect simple data from observations or questions
  - Organize data using sorting or grouping
  - Represent collected data using pictures, symbols, or tally marks
problem_types:
  - Pattern continuation
  - Pattern creation
  - Pattern error detection
  - AB pattern
  - ABC pattern
  - Attribute pattern
  - Data collection
  - Tally marks
  - Picture graph
  - Data sorting
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple AB patterns (2 elements repeating)
    - Data sets with 5-10 items maximum
    - Clear visual patterns with colors or shapes
  medium:
    - ABC or ABB patterns (3 elements)
    - Data sets with 10-15 items
    - Patterns with 2 changing attributes (color and shape)
  hard:
    - Complex patterns (ABCD, AABB, growing patterns)
    - Data sets with 15-20 items
    - Patterns requiring analysis of multiple attributes
prerequisites: []
real_world_context:
  - Patterns appear in nature (flower petals, animal stripes, tree rings)
  - Daily routines follow patterns (wake up, breakfast, school, play, dinner, sleep)
  - Clothing and fabric designs use repeating patterns (stripes, polka dots, checks)
  - Collecting data helps answer questions like "What is the most popular ice cream flavor?"
  - Tally marks help count attendance, votes, or favorite activities in class
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid patterns with more than 4 different elements
  - Don't use abstract symbols unfamiliar to 6-7 year olds
  - Avoid data collection scenarios requiring reading complex text
  - Don't combine pattern recognition with arithmetic operations
  - Avoid patterns that require knowledge of sequences beyond simple repetition
