name: Data and Probability Basics
description: Collecting and organizing data, using probability language, and exploring random events in everyday contexts
grade: 1
ages:
  - 6
  - 7
focus: Data, Frequency, and Probability
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Collect and organize simple data from immediate environment
  - Use tally marks to record counts and create basic tables
  - Use probability vocabulary in everyday contexts (certain, possible, impossible)
  - Distinguish between certain and impossible events
  - Read and interpret simple data representations
  - Conduct and describe simple random experiments
problem_types:
  - Reading table values
  - Comparing data categories
  - Tally mark interpretation
  - Event classification (certain/possible/impossible)
  - Outcome prediction from known contents
  - Data organization tasks
  - Simple probability comparisons
  - Calculate totals/differences from data
  - Random experiment descriptions
  - Identify most/least frequent
age_guidelines:
  6:
    - Small datasets (3-5 categories, 1-10 items each)
    - Clear visual support with pictures/symbols
    - Simple tally marks (no bundles of five)
    - Obvious probability events (elephant in classroom = impossible)
    - Direct value reading, single comparisons
  7:
    - Larger datasets (up to 6-8 categories, up to 15 items)
    - Tally mark bundles (groups of five)
    - Two-step data interpretations
    - Probability reasoning with known bag contents
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct table reading or obvious event classification
    - Single category identification (most/least)
  medium:
    - Create tallies, organize data, calculate totals or differences
    - Possible-but-uncertain events, combine two categories
  hard:
    - Multi-step calculations from data
    - Unequal probabilities (spinner with different-sized sections)
    - Complex datasets, justify probability classifications
prerequisites: []
real_world_context: |
  First-graders encounter data collection and chance events daily - counting classmates with different eye colors, tracking weather patterns, playing games with dice or spinners, and making predictions about everyday events. Understanding basic data organization and probability language helps children make sense of information around them, develop logical reasoning about uncertainty, and build foundational skills for statistical thinking.
version: 4
version_notes: |
  Version 4: Migrated to frontmatter-based format. Problem types, age guidelines, and difficulty guidelines moved from prompt content to frontmatter fields.
