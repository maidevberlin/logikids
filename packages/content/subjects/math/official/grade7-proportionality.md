id: grade7-proportionality
name: Proportionality
description: Recognizing and applying direct and inverse proportional relationships, creating ratio tables, graphing proportional functions, and distinguishing between proportional and non-proportional situations in real-world contexts
grade: 7
focus: Proportional relationships and applications
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize direct proportional relationships and describe them using quotient equality
  - Recognize inverse proportional relationships and describe them using product equality
  - Create and complete ratio tables for proportional relationships
  - Graph direct and inverse proportional relationships on coordinate planes
  - Solve real-world problems using proportional reasoning
  - Distinguish between direct, inverse, and non-proportional situations
  - Apply proportionality concepts to calculate unknown values in practical contexts
problem_types:
  - Ratio table completion
  - Proportionality identification
  - Direct proportion calculation
  - Inverse proportion calculation
  - Graph interpretation
  - Graph creation
  - Real-world application
  - Proportionality type comparison
  - Multi-step proportion problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct proportions with whole number ratios (1:2, 1:3, 2:5)
    - Simple ratio tables with given multiplicative factors
    - Identifying whether a relationship is proportional from given data
  medium:
    - Inverse proportions with straightforward contexts (speed-time, workers-days)
    - Creating graphs from proportional relationships
    - Calculating unknown values using proportionality rules
  hard:
    - Distinguishing direct from inverse proportionality in complex scenarios
    - Multi-step problems combining different proportional relationships
    - Analyzing non-proportional situations and explaining why they are not proportional
prerequisites:
  - grade6-fractions-basics
  - grade6-rational-multiplication-division
real_world_context:
  - Recipe scaling requires direct proportionality (doubling ingredients doubles the recipe)
  - Speed and travel time demonstrate inverse proportionality (faster speed means less time)
  - Currency exchange rates use direct proportionality for converting between currencies
  - Work completion time depends inversely on the number of workers (more workers, less time)
  - Map scales use direct proportionality to relate map distances to real distances
  - Musicians adjusting metronome tempo inversely affects time to play a piece
  - Photographers using aperture settings where light and exposure are inversely related
  - Cyclists experiencing inverse proportionality between gear ratio and pedaling effort
  - Paint mixing requiring direct proportionality to maintain consistent colors
  - Video streaming quality inversely proportional to number of users sharing bandwidth
  - Fuel efficiency calculations using distance traveled per liter of gasoline
  - Shadow lengths directly proportional to object heights at the same time of day
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing direct and inverse proportionality in a single problem
  - Do not use proportions where additive patterns would be more appropriate
  - Avoid contexts unfamiliar to 12-13 year olds (compound interest, physics)
  - Do not present ratio tables with inconsistent or non-proportional data
  - Avoid graphs without clear axis labels and scale markings
