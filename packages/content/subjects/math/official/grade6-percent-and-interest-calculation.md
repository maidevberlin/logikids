# Percent and Interest Calculation Tasks

Create problems that help students understand simple interest calculation and connect it to percentage concepts. Focus on the basic formula $I = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}$ where $I$ is interest, $P$ is principal (capital), $r$ is rate (%), and $t$ is time in years.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Vary finding interest:** "{{name}} deposits {{principal}}€ in a savings account with {{rate}}% annual interest. How much interest will {{he/she}} earn after {{years}} year(s)?" Use $I = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}$
- **Vary finding total amount:** "{{principal}}€ is invested at {{rate}}% for {{years}} year(s). What is the total amount (principal + interest) at the end?" Calculate $A = P + I = P + \frac{P \times r \times t}{100} = P(1 + \frac{r \times t}{100})$
- **Vary finding the principal:** "After 1 year at {{rate}}% interest, {{name}} received {{interest}}€ in interest. How much was the original deposit?"
- **Vary finding the rate:** "{{principal}}€ earned {{interest}}€ interest in {{years}} year(s). What was the annual interest rate?"
- **Vary finding the time:** "How long does it take for {{principal}}€ to earn {{interest}}€ at {{rate}}% annual interest?"

**Vary the numbers:**
- For beginners: Round principals (1000€, 2000€, 5000€), simple rates (2%, 5%, 10%), time = 1 year
- For intermediate: Non-round principals (1250€, 3500€), decimal rates (2.5%, 3.75%, 4.25%), time = 2-3 years
- For advanced: Larger principals (10000€, 25000€), complex rates (3.125%, 4.875%), fractional years (0.5 years, 1.5 years)

**Vary the context:**
- Savings scenarios: child's savings account, birthday money invested, weekly allowance accumulated
- Loan scenarios (simple): borrowing money from parents, school club loan, simple bank loan
- Investment scenarios: investing gift money, saving for a bicycle/game console
- Comparison scenarios: "Bank A offers {{rate1}}% and Bank B offers {{rate2}}%. Which is better for {{principal}}€ over {{years}} years?"

**Vary the question type:**
- Direct calculation: Calculate interest or total amount given all values
- Reverse calculation: Find principal, rate, or time when given interest
- Table completion: Fill in missing values in a table with columns for Principal, Rate, Time, Interest, Total Amount
- Multi-step problems: "{{name}} saves {{monthly}}€ per month. After {{months}} months, the money is deposited at {{rate}}% for {{years}} year(s). What is the final amount?"
- Comparison problems: Compare two different investment options and determine which yields more interest

**Real-world applications:**
- Birthday savings: "You receive 500€ for your birthday and put it in a savings account..."
- Goal-based saving: "You want to buy a bicycle for 800€. You have 600€ and can invest it at 5% for 2 years..."
- Simple loan understanding: "Your parents lend you 200€ at 2% interest for 1 year to buy a game. How much do you pay back?"

**Table structure for systematic practice:**

| Principal ($P$) | Rate ($r$) | Time ($t$) | Interest ($I$) | Total ($A$) |
|-----------------|------------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1000€           | 5%         | 1 year     | ?              | ?           |
| 2000€           | ?          | 2 years    | 120€           | ?           |
| ?               | 4%         | 1 year     | 80€            | ?           |

**Formula variations to emphasize:**
- Basic interest: $I = \frac{P \times r \times t}{100}$
- Total amount: $A = P + I = P \times (1 + \frac{r \times t}{100})$
- Finding principal: $P = \frac{I \times 100}{r \times t}$
- Finding rate: $r = \frac{I \times 100}{P \times t}$
- Finding time: $t = \frac{I \times 100}{P \times r}$

**Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions and formulas.**
