# Geometry and Symmetry - Grade 2

## Task Generation Guidelines

Create tasks that help second graders explore geometric solids and discover the beauty of symmetry through hands-on thinking and visual analysis. Tasks should encourage discovery-based learning where students identify patterns, create symmetric designs, and describe geometric properties using age-appropriate language.

## Core Concepts to Address

### Geometric Solids (Bodies/Körper)
Students should work with three-dimensional figures, learning to describe them using precise vocabulary: faces (flat surfaces), edges (where two faces meet), and corners/vertices (where edges meet). Tasks should help students visualize and count these elements in common solids like cubes, rectangular boxes, cylinders, spheres, cones, and pyramids.

### Axial Symmetry (Achsensymmetrie)
Students should recognize that an axially symmetric figure has two congruent halves that mirror each other across a line called the axis of symmetry or mirror line (Symmetrieachse/Spiegelachse). Tasks should guide students to identify this line and understand that if you fold along it, both halves match perfectly.

### Creating Symmetric Figures
Students should experience creating symmetry through various methods: folding paper and cutting shapes, making ink blot pictures (Klecksbilder), drawing on grid paper where one half mirrors the other, and arranging geometric shapes to form symmetric patterns.

### Symmetry in the Environment
Students should discover symmetry all around them: in their own bodies (left-right symmetry), in nature (butterflies, leaves, flowers), in buildings and architecture, in letters and numbers, and in everyday objects.

## Problem Type Variations

Generate diverse task types that explore symmetry and geometric properties from different angles:

**Identification Tasks**: Present figures or objects and ask students to identify whether they are symmetric, locate all lines of symmetry, or count how many symmetry axes exist.

**Completion Tasks**: Show half of a symmetric figure and ask students to visualize or describe what the complete figure would look like, or present an incomplete symmetric pattern and ask what's missing.

**Comparison Tasks**: Compare multiple figures to determine which have more or fewer symmetry lines, which solids have more faces or edges, or which objects in a scene show symmetry.

**Creation and Design Tasks**: Challenge students to design their own symmetric patterns using given shapes, create a symmetric figure that meets certain criteria (like having exactly two symmetry axes), or arrange geometric pieces to form a symmetric design.

**Property Description Tasks**: Ask students to describe the properties of a geometric solid using correct vocabulary, explain why a figure is or isn't symmetric, or describe what happens when you fold a symmetric figure along its mirror line.

**Real-World Connection Tasks**: Present photographs or drawings of objects from nature or daily life and ask students to identify symmetric elements, count symmetry lines in letters or numbers, or find examples of specific types of symmetry.

**Classification Tasks**: Sort figures into groups based on whether they're symmetric or not, classify solids by their number of faces or edges, or organize shapes by how many symmetry axes they have.

**Verification Tasks**: Present a statement about a figure's symmetry or a solid's properties and ask whether it's correct, or show a claimed line of symmetry and ask whether it's actually a mirror line.

**Spatial Reasoning Tasks**: Present questions about what you would see if you rotated a solid to view it from different angles, what shape results when you fold and cut paper in specific ways, or predict the outcome of creating an ink blot picture with certain starting shapes.

**Pattern Extension Tasks**: Show a pattern that exhibits symmetry and ask students to continue it while maintaining the symmetric property, or present a partially symmetric design and ask how to complete it to make it fully symmetric.

## Age-Appropriate Complexity ({{age}})

**Age 7**: Focus on recognizing obvious visual symmetry, simple identification tasks, counting basic properties of familiar solids (like cube faces), and creating symmetric figures through folding and cutting. Use clear, single axis of symmetry and highly visual representations.

**Age 8**: Include more subtle symmetry examples, figures with multiple symmetry axes, less common geometric solids, comparison between different types of symmetry, and more complex creation tasks involving grid paper or specific design constraints.

## Difficulty Scaling ({{difficulty}})

**Easy**: Present clear, obvious examples of symmetry with single mirror lines, familiar geometric solids with easily countable properties, direct identification questions, and creation tasks with heavy scaffolding or visual guides.

**Medium**: Include figures with multiple symmetry axes, require students to explain their reasoning about why something is or isn't symmetric, present less obvious symmetry examples, ask for comparisons between multiple figures, and include solids with more complex properties.

**Hard**: Challenge students with figures that appear symmetric but aren't (requiring careful verification), ask for creation of figures meeting multiple criteria simultaneously, present complex patterns where symmetry must be discovered rather than obvious, include solids requiring spatial visualization from different angles, and ask students to identify all possible symmetry axes in a complex figure.

## Visual Representation Guidance

Tasks should include appropriate visual support without providing code examples that could be copied:

**For Geometric Solids**: Describe showing three-dimensional shapes from helpful viewing angles that make faces, edges, and corners clearly visible. Use perspective drawings that help students count properties accurately. Consider showing the same solid from multiple viewpoints when spatial reasoning is important.

**For Symmetry Tasks**: Describe showing figures with clear outlines where students can easily identify potential mirror lines. For completion tasks, show exactly half of a figure with the mirror line clearly indicated. For creation tasks on grid paper, describe the grid structure that helps students maintain symmetry when drawing.

**For Real-World Examples**: Describe photographs or illustrations of real objects that exhibit symmetry (butterfly wings, building facades, flower petals, letters) or geometric solids in everyday contexts (dice, boxes, balls, traffic cones).

**For Pattern Tasks**: Describe symmetric patterns using geometric shapes arranged in ways that demonstrate the mirror principle, making it easy for students to see corresponding elements on both sides of the symmetry axis.

## Numerical and Parametric Variation

**For Property Counting**: Vary the types of solids used (cubes, rectangular boxes, pyramids with different bases, cylinders, cones, spheres) so students encounter different numbers of faces, edges, and corners. Include solids with very different counts to build understanding of geometric diversity.

**For Symmetry Axes**: Vary the number of symmetry lines from zero (asymmetric shapes) through one (most simple symmetric figures) to multiple axes (circles, squares, equilateral triangles, regular hexagons). Present figures oriented in different directions so students don't assume symmetry axes are always vertical or horizontal.

**For Figure Complexity**: Vary the complexity of symmetric figures from very simple geometric shapes to more intricate patterns, from single-shape figures to compositions of multiple shapes, and from abstract geometric designs to recognizable objects or pictures.

**For Grid Tasks**: When using grid paper for creation or completion tasks, vary the grid size, the scale of the figure on the grid, and the position of the mirror line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal when appropriate for the age group).

## Language and Terminology

Use age-appropriate but mathematically correct vocabulary. Introduce terms gradually: start with "mirror line" or "folding line" before "axis of symmetry," use "matches" or "same on both sides" before "congruent halves," and describe solids as having "flat sides" (faces), "places where sides meet" (edges), and "pointy parts" or "meeting points" (vertices/corners).

Allow students to use informal language initially ("you can fold it and it matches") while gently introducing precise mathematical terms. Questions should model correct vocabulary without being pedantic about requiring it in student responses for this grade level.

## Context and Scenario Variety

The backend variation system handles diverse contexts, so don't duplicate those efforts here. However, ensure tasks can naturally incorporate various settings: nature observations, art and design activities, architecture and buildings, letter and number recognition, everyday objects and toys, seasonal themes, and cultural patterns.

## Common Misconceptions to Address

**Not All Similar-Looking Shapes Are Symmetric**: Some figures appear balanced but don't have mirror symmetry. Tasks should occasionally include these to develop careful verification skills.

**Symmetry Lines Must Go Through the Figure**: Help students understand that the mirror line divides the figure into two matching halves, not just any line that creates two pieces.

**More Faces Means Bigger**: Students might confuse the number of faces with the size of the solid. Include tasks where smaller solids have more faces than larger ones.

**All Lines Through the Center Are Symmetry Axes**: Only specific lines create mirror symmetry. Particularly important when students encounter circles or regular polygons.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do NOT provide specific visual examples that could be copied verbatim. Do NOT list specific figures with their exact number of symmetry axes as examples. Do NOT show LaTeX code or SVG code for how to draw symmetric figures. Do NOT give detailed numerical examples of solid properties that would be reused.

Instead, describe the PRINCIPLES of what makes good variations, the TYPES of figures to use, and the CHARACTERISTICS that distinguish difficulty levels.
