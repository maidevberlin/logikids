id: grade2-geometry-and-symmetry
name: Geometry and Symmetry
description: Exploring geometric solid properties and creating symmetrical figures with mirror lines
grade: 2
ages:
  - 7
  - 8
focus: Space and Shape (Raum und Form)
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Describe properties of geometric solids using precise vocabulary (faces, edges, corners)
  - Identify axially symmetric figures and their lines of symmetry
  - Create symmetric figures through folding, cutting, and drawing
  - Discover symmetry in the human body and the environment
  - Distinguish between figures with different numbers of symmetry axes
prerequisites:
  - grade1-geometric-solids
  - grade1-plane-figures
real_world_context: Symmetry appears in nature (butterfly wings, flower petals, leaves) and human design (architecture, letters, human body). Understanding symmetry helps recognize patterns and develop spatial reasoning for art, design, and science.
problem_types:
  - Identify symmetry
  - Count symmetry axes
  - Complete symmetric figures
  - Compare symmetry
  - Describe solid properties
  - Create symmetric patterns
  - Classify by symmetry
  - Verify symmetry claims
  - Spatial reasoning
  - Pattern extension
age_guidelines:
  7:
    - Focus on obvious visual symmetry with single axis
    - Simple identification tasks
    - Count basic properties of familiar solids (cube faces)
    - Create symmetric figures through folding and cutting
    - Use highly visual representations
  8:
    - Include subtle symmetry examples
    - Figures with multiple symmetry axes
    - Less common geometric solids
    - Compare different types of symmetry
    - Complex creation tasks with grid paper or design constraints
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Clear, obvious symmetry with single mirror lines
    - Familiar geometric solids with easily countable properties
    - Direct identification questions
    - Creation tasks with scaffolding or visual guides
  medium:
    - Figures with multiple symmetry axes
    - Explain reasoning about symmetry
    - Less obvious symmetry examples
    - Compare multiple figures
    - Solids with more complex properties
  hard:
    - Figures that appear symmetric but aren't
    - Create figures meeting multiple criteria simultaneously
    - Complex patterns where symmetry must be discovered
    - Solids requiring spatial visualization from different angles
    - Identify all possible symmetry axes in complex figures
