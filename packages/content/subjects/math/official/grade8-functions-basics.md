id: grade8-functions-basics
name: Functions and Terms
description: Understanding the function concept as a unique assignment, distinguishing function terminology (function term, graph, domain, range), using tables and diagrams to represent functions, and determining function values and intersection points
grade: 8
focus: Function concept and terminology
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand a function as a unique assignment from domain to range
  - Distinguish between functions and non-unique assignments with justification
  - Identify and correctly use function-related terms (function term, graph, domain, range)
  - Use tables, diagrams, and terms to describe functional relationships
  - Determine function values from graphs, tables, or function terms
  - Find intersection points of function graphs with coordinate axes
  - Describe how function values change as input values vary
problem_types:
  - Function vs non-function identification
  - Domain and range determination
  - Function value calculation
  - Graph interpretation
  - Table completion
  - Axis intersection finding
  - Function behavior description
  - Multiple representations
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Functions with small integer domains (0 to 10)
    - Simple function terms like f(x) = 2x or f(x) = x + 3
    - Reading function values directly from tables or graphs
  medium:
    - Functions with larger domains including negative integers
    - Function terms with combined operations like f(x) = 3x - 5
    - Determining domain and range from graphs or descriptions
  hard:
    - Functions with restricted or non-standard domains
    - Analyzing whether complex assignments are functions
    - Describing function behavior using precise mathematical language
prerequisites:
  - grade7-proportionality
  - grade6-coordinate-system
real_world_context:
  - Electricity tariffs show a functional relationship between kilowatt-hours used and total cost
  - Temperature curves represent time as input and temperature as output over a day
  - Population development graphs show year as input and population size as output
  - Online shopping calculates shipping cost as a function of package weight
  - Taxi fares depend on distance traveled showing a functional relationship
  - Video game character stats mapping experience points to skill levels
  - Streaming subscriptions showing quality options as a function of bandwidth
  - Fitness trackers displaying heart rate as a function of time during exercise
  - Restaurant pricing menus where dish price is a function of portion size
  - Library late fees calculated as a function of days overdue
  - Social media follower counts graphed as a function of account age
  - Plant growth charts showing height as a function of weeks after planting
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid introducing function composition or inverse functions
  - Do not use piecewise-defined functions or absolute value functions
  - Avoid domains or ranges involving irrational numbers or complex decimals
  - Do not mix function notation with equation solving in the same problem
  - Avoid contexts requiring knowledge beyond grade 8 (economics, physics)
