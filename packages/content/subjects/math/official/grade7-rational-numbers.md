real_world_context: The rational number system is fundamental to modern life and professional work. Scientists and engineers work with rational numbers in measurements, calculations, and data analysis (±0.5 mm tolerances in manufacturing, ±0.1°C in chemistry). Financial professionals use rational numbers for interest calculations, currency conversions, and investment returns (3.5% annual return, €4.75 per unit). Cooks and nutritionists work with fractional quantities and decimal measurements (recipes scaled by 1.5×, nutritional values like 2.5g protein per 100g). Medical professionals use decimal measurements and percentages (dose calculations at 0.25mg per kg, 95% efficacy rates). Statisticians and economists present data using decimals and percentages (unemployment at 5.2%, temperature anomaly of -0.3°C). Grade 7 students apply rational numbers when converting currencies, calculating discounts and sales tax, understanding grades and percentages, analyzing sports statistics, working with temperatures and elevation changes, and solving practical measurement problems. Mastery of rational numbers is essential for proportional reasoning, algebra, and advanced mathematics in secondary and higher education.
problem_types:
  - rational number ordering
  - sign and absolute value
  - mixed representation addition
  - rational multiplication
  - rational division
  - multi-step operations
  - conversion tasks
  - percentage problems
age_guidelines:
  12:
    - emphasize connections between representations and visual/concrete models
    - use smaller denominators and simpler decimal values initially
    - include step-by-step problem structure with explicit guidance
    - provide worked examples showing multiple solution strategies
    - use familiar contexts (money, cooking, sports)
    - include visual representations (number lines, area models)
    - focus on understanding why procedures work
    - keep most problems to 2-3 operations
    - explicitly teach sign rules and absolute value
  13:
    - emphasize strategic choice of representations
    - use broader range of denominators and decimal values
    - present less-structured multi-step problems
    - minimize worked examples
    - use diverse and abstract contexts
    - reduce visual representations
    - assume procedural understanding
    - include complex multi-operation expressions
    - discuss multiple solution approaches
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - not applicable for this concept
    - refer to introduction-fractions.md or fraction-operations.md
  medium:
    - single representations only
    - smaller numerators/denominators
    - explicit step-by-step structure
    - 2-3 operations maximum
    - emphasize visual representations
    - use familiar contexts
  hard:
    - multi-step problems with 3+ operations
    - mixed representations in single problems
    - strategic representation choice matters
    - complex word problems requiring interpretation
    - both positive and negative rational numbers
    - conversion between multiple representations
    - minimal visual support
    - real-world contexts with multiple calculation steps
    - justification of solution methods required
    - emphasis on efficiency and elegant strategies
    - problems where obvious approach is not most efficient
