name: Data and Combinatorics
description: Collecting, organizing, and interpreting data; systematic counting and simple combinations
grade: 3
focus: Data analysis and systematic counting
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Collect data systematically using surveys, observations, or experiments
  - Organize data into tables, tally charts, and frequency lists
  - Create bar graphs and pictographs to represent collected data
  - Interpret data representations and answer questions about the information
  - Use systematic counting strategies to find all possible combinations
  - Solve simple combinatorial problems involving choices and arrangements
  - Compare different data sets and draw simple conclusions
problem_types:
  - Data collection planning
  - Tally chart creation
  - Bar graph interpretation
  - Frequency table analysis
  - Combination counting
  - Systematic listing
  - Data comparison
  - Survey design
  - Pictograph reading
  - Tree diagram basics
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Data sets with 3-4 categories and 10-20 total items
    - Simple combination problems with 2 choices (e.g., 3 shirts, 2 pants)
    - Direct reading from completed graphs or tables
  medium:
    - Data sets with 4-6 categories and 20-40 total items
    - Combination problems with 3 choices or 2-3 items per choice
    - Questions requiring comparison or calculation from data
  hard:
    - Data sets with 6-8 categories and 40-60 total items
    - Combination problems with 4+ choices or constraints
    - Multi-step questions requiring analysis and reasoning about data
prerequisites:
  - grade1-patterns-and-data
  - grade2-introduction-to-chance
real_world_context:
  - Class surveys about favorite activities, foods, or colors help make decisions for events
  - Sports statistics show which team scored most goals or which player performed best
  - Weather data collected over weeks shows patterns in temperature or rainfall
  - Choosing outfits involves combining different clothing items systematically
  - Menu planning requires counting combinations of main dishes, sides, and drinks
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid data sets requiring reading or interpreting numbers beyond 1000
  - Don't use complex probability calculations or percentages
  - Avoid combination problems with more than 4 different categories
  - Don't require creation of complex multi-axis graphs
  - Avoid statistical terms like mean, median, mode, or range
