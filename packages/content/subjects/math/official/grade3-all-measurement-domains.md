# All Measurement Domains

Generate tasks that integrate multiple measurement domains (lengths, mass, volume, time) requiring students to convert between units and solve practical problems using standard measurement tools and reference points.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse problem types across all measurement domains:

1. **Single-domain conversion**: Convert values within one measurement area using multiple unit steps
2. **Multi-domain comparison**: Compare quantities from different domains in real-world contexts
3. **Measurement tool selection**: Identify appropriate measuring instruments for specific situations
4. **Estimation with reference points**: Use everyday objects as reference sizes for approximation
5. **Multi-step calculations**: Combine conversions with arithmetic operations across different domains
6. **Practical application**: Solve authentic problems requiring measurement knowledge (cooking recipes, travel distances, time schedules)
7. **Reverse calculation**: Find unknown starting values when given converted results
8. **Proportional reasoning**: Scale measurements up or down while maintaining relationships
9. **Error detection**: Identify incorrect conversions or unreasonable measurement claims
10. **Unit selection optimization**: Choose the most appropriate unit for a given context

## Measurement Domain Coverage

Ensure variety across all four domains with appropriate unit scales:

**Lengths**: Include conversions across multiple unit scales (very small to very large)
- Short distances (classroom objects to building dimensions)
- Medium distances (neighborhood to city scale)
- Long distances (regional to country scale)

**Mass**: Include different weight scales from light to heavy
- Light objects (everyday items, food portions)
- Medium weights (people, furniture, animals)
- Heavy loads (vehicles, construction materials)

**Volume Measures**: Include different volume scales from small to large
- Small volumes (medicine, spices)
- Everyday containers (bottles, glasses, pots)
- Large containers (aquariums, bathtubs, fuel tanks)

**Time**: Include different time period scales from short to long
- Short durations (activities, tasks)
- Medium spans (school day, sleep, travel)
- Long periods (seasons, projects, age)

## Numerical Variation Principles

Generate diverse numerical values using these principles:

- **Multiple orders of magnitude**: Span from very small units to very large units across all measurement domains
- **Cross-boundary conversions**: Require conversions that cross multiple unit boundaries within a single measurement domain
- **Mixed representation**: Present values in combined formats requiring interpretation and conversion
- **Non-round numbers**: Include values that don't convert to whole numbers cleanly, requiring careful calculation
- **Contextual appropriateness**: Match number scales to realistic scenarios appropriate for each measurement domain
- **Comparative relationships**: Create situations where students compare measurements across different unit systems

## Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

Adjust problem complexity based on student age using `{{age}}` variable:

**Younger students ({{age}} = 8)**:
- Focus on simpler conversions within adjacent units
- Use whole numbers and common fractions
- Provide visual or concrete references for estimation
- Single-step problems with clear contexts
- Familiar everyday situations (classroom, home, playground)

**Older students ({{age}} = 9)**:
- Include conversions across multiple unit steps
- Introduce decimal notation for mixed units
- Require multi-step reasoning combining conversion with calculation
- More abstract contexts requiring domain knowledge
- Time calculations spanning multiple time periods

## Difficulty Scaling with {{difficulty}}

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy)**:
- Direct conversions between two adjacent units
- Whole number results
- Clear visual or contextual support
- One measurement domain per problem
- Common everyday measurements

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium)**:
- Conversions across multiple unit steps
- Mixed whole numbers and decimals
- Combine two different measurement domains
- Multi-step problems requiring intermediate calculations
- Moderate estimation challenges

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard)**:
- Complex conversions across entire unit range
- Integrate three or more measurement domains
- Reverse calculations finding unknown starting values
- Problems requiring proportional reasoning or scaling
- Abstract scenarios requiring deep understanding of unit relationships

## Measurement Tool and Reference Point Guidance

Include realistic measurement contexts:

**Tools**: Describe which tools students might use (rulers, meter sticks, tape measures, scales, measuring cups, clocks, calendars) without providing specific procedural steps

**Reference Points**: Encourage use of everyday comparisons to build intuition about measurement sizes and relationships

**Estimation Skills**: Create situations where exact measurement isn't possible, requiring reasonable approximations based on known reference sizes

## Format and Presentation

**Tables**: Use when comparing multiple measurements across domains or showing conversion relationships

**Diagrams**: Describe measurement scenarios visually when spatial relationships matter (not for simple number conversions)

**Real-world contexts**: Embed all problems in authentic situations (shopping, cooking, sports, construction, travel, science) that require practical measurement application

**Mixed formats**: Alternate between asking for exact conversions, estimates, tool selection, and problem-solving

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Formulaic repetition: Don't create multiple problems with identical structure changing only numbers
- Single-domain focus: Ensure tasks integrate multiple measurement areas, not just length conversions repeatedly
- Trivial conversions: Avoid overly simple conversions that don't challenge understanding
- Unrealistic contexts: Don't create situations with inappropriate unit usage for the measurement context
- Pure memorization: Always embed conversions in meaningful contexts requiring understanding, not just factor recall
- Abstract drill: Ground all practice in real-world situations where measurement matters
