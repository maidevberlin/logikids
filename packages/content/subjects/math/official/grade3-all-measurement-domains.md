name: All Measurement Domains
description: Converting units and solving problems across lengths, mass, volume, and time measurements
grade: 3
ages:
  - 8
  - 9
focus: Measurement and quantities
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Know standard units for lengths, mass, volume, and time across multiple scale ranges
  - Convert fluently between units within the same measurement domain
  - Measure accurately using appropriate tools and instruments
  - Solve practical problems involving multiple measurement domains
  - Use everyday reference points for estimating and comparing quantities
prerequisites:
  - grade2-measuring-lengths
  - grade2-time-spans
real_world_context: "Everyday situations requiring measurement and unit conversion including cooking, shopping, travel planning, construction projects, and science experiments. Aligned with German curriculum (Rahmenlehrplan) Grade 3 measurement competencies: converting between units in standard domains, solving multi-step measurement problems, and applying measurement knowledge in authentic contexts."
problem_types:
  - single-domain conversion
  - multi-domain comparison
  - tool selection
  - estimation tasks
  - multi-step calculations
  - practical application
  - reverse calculation
  - proportional reasoning
  - error detection
  - unit optimization
age_guidelines:
  8:
    - Focus on simpler conversions within adjacent units
    - Use whole numbers and common fractions
    - Provide visual or concrete references for estimation
    - Single-step problems with clear contexts
    - Familiar everyday situations (classroom, home, playground)
  9:
    - Include conversions across multiple unit steps
    - Introduce decimal notation for mixed units
    - Require multi-step reasoning combining conversion with calculation
    - More abstract contexts requiring domain knowledge
    - Time calculations spanning multiple time periods
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct conversions between two adjacent units
    - Whole number results
    - Clear visual or contextual support
    - One measurement domain per problem
    - Common everyday measurements
  medium:
    - Conversions across multiple unit steps
    - Mixed whole numbers and decimals
    - Combine two different measurement domains
    - Multi-step problems requiring intermediate calculations
    - Moderate estimation challenges
  hard:
    - Complex conversions across entire unit range
    - Integrate three or more measurement domains
    - Reverse calculations finding unknown starting values
    - Problems requiring proportional reasoning or scaling
    - Abstract scenarios requiring deep understanding of unit relationships
