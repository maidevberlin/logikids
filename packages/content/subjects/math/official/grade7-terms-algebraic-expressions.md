# Terms and Algebraic Expressions

Generate tasks that help students develop proficiency with variables, writing and interpreting algebraic expressions, simplifying using like terms and the distributive property, and evaluating expressions. This is a critical transition from concrete arithmetic to abstract algebraic thinking.

## Problem Type Variations

Create diverse task structures representing core algebraic competencies:

1. **Variable Understanding**: Explain what a variable represents in a given context, identify whether a specific variable is appropriate for a situation, or describe what a variable means in a formula (e.g., "What does v represent in d = vt?"). Connect variables to their real-world meanings.

2. **Writing Expressions from Words**: Convert written descriptions into algebraic expressions (e.g., "three times a number decreased by five" → 3n - 5), including contexts with two or more variables, and situations requiring correct operational order.

3. **Interpreting Expressions**: Read an algebraic expression and explain its meaning in plain language, identify which operation is performed first, or determine what real-world quantity it represents. Build connection between symbols and meaning.

4. **Combining Like Terms**: Simplify expressions by combining like terms (e.g., 4a + 2b + 3a - b → 7a + b), including expressions with variables in different forms and negative coefficients. Address misconceptions about when terms can be combined.

5. **Distributive Property - Expanding**: Apply the distributive property to expand expressions (e.g., 2(3x + 4) → 6x + 8, or -3(a - 2) → -3a + 6), including cases with negative factors and multi-variable expressions. Use area models for visualization.

6. **Evaluating Expressions**: Substitute given numerical values for variables and calculate the result (e.g., evaluate 2x + 5 when x = 3), including negative values, fractions, and multi-variable expressions. Focus on careful substitution and order of operations.

7. **Equivalent Expressions**: Determine whether two expressions are equivalent by simplifying both or evaluating with test values (e.g., are 2(x + 3) and 2x + 6 equivalent?). Connect multiple representations of the same quantity.

8. **Pattern Recognition and Expression Writing**: Analyze number sequences or geometric patterns and write expressions to find the nth term (e.g., figure 1 has 3 dots, figure 2 has 5 dots, figure 3 has 7 dots → the nth figure has 2n + 1 dots). Develop understanding of how expressions generalize patterns.

## Age-Based Scaffolding

Adapt complexity based on student age and development:

**For younger students ({{age}} < 13):**
- Use concrete contexts with clear real-world meanings (money, distances, ages)
- Start with single-variable expressions before introducing two variables
- Use simple integer coefficients and constants (mostly positive initially)
- Provide visual representations (area models for distributive property, bar diagrams for expressions)
- Include abundant scaffolding: sentence starters, partially worked examples, variable definitions
- Begin with one operation per expression before combining multiple operations
- Use small whole numbers initially (avoiding large or negative numbers)
- Emphasize the connection between written language, diagrams, and symbolic expressions

**For older students ({{age}} >= 13):**
- Include expressions with multiple variables and more complex relationships
- Work with negative coefficients and constants naturally
- Include multi-step simplification and evaluation problems
- Require justification and explanation of simplification steps
- Use abstract contexts alongside real-world applications
- Include fraction and decimal coefficients (introduce carefully)
- Connect algebraic work to geometric formulas and patterns
- Introduce factoring as the reverse of distributive property

## Difficulty Scaling

Adjust problem complexity based on difficulty level:

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = 'easy'):**
- Work with single variables in most problems
- Simple positive coefficients and whole number constants (typically 1-10)
- Single operations or straightforward combinations (addition/subtraction)
- Clear real-world contexts with obvious variable meanings
- Concrete numbers for evaluation (typically whole numbers 1-10)
- Minimal negative numbers; when included, clearly marked
- Direct substitution without requiring simplification
- Like terms clearly identifiable with matching variable forms
- Distributive property with simple factors (mostly 2 or 3)
- No fractions or decimals in coefficients

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = 'medium'):**
- Mix of single and two-variable expressions
- Coefficients and constants from -20 to +20
- Multiple operations requiring careful order of operations
- Mix of concrete and moderately abstract contexts
- Evaluation with integers including negatives (roughly -10 to +10)
- Require simplification before or after evaluation
- Like terms with different presentations (e.g., 2x and x require adding 2 + 1)
- Distributive property with factors up to 10, including some negative factors
- Introduction to simple fractional coefficients (1/2, 1/3, etc.)
- Multi-step simplification combining like terms and distributive property
- Connecting expressions to perimeter and area formulas

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = 'hard'):**
- Expressions with multiple variables and operations
- Coefficients and constants with wider ranges, including fractions and decimals
- Three or more operations with correct order of operations
- Abstract contexts requiring interpretation and relationship identification
- Evaluation with varied integers, fractions, and decimals
- Complex simplification involving nested parentheses
- Factoring expressions to find greatest common factors
- Algebraic manipulation to verify equivalence
- Multi-step problems combining writing, simplifying, and evaluating expressions
- Problems requiring planning and strategic thinking
- Applications to geometric problems with variable dimensions
- Patterns requiring analysis of multiple terms to derive expressions

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Generate diverse numbers and combinations following these principles:

- **Coefficient variety**: Mix coefficients of 1 (where x means 1x), small whole numbers (2-10), and occasionally larger values or fractions
- **Sign variety**: Include positive coefficients, negative coefficients, and zero coefficients (where a term disappears)
- **Constant variety**: Include positive, negative, and zero constants; vary their magnitudes
- **Variable combinations**: When using multiple variables, include all pairs naturally; avoid always using x and y
- **Evaluation numbers**: Vary between small positive integers, zero, and negative integers; for older students include fractions and decimals
- **Term quantity**: Include expressions with 2 terms, 3 terms, 4+ terms; vary with and without like terms present
- **Operation sequencing**: In word problems, vary which operation comes first (e.g., "doubled then decreased" vs. "decreased then doubled")
- **Context variety**: Rotate through money, distance, time, area, volume, age, and abstract mathematical contexts
- **Pattern complexity**: Number sequences with constant differences (arithmetic sequences) should include various step sizes (not always +1)

## Format and Presentation Guidance

### When to Use Visual Elements

**For {{age}} = 12 or {{difficulty}} = easy:**
- Include area models or rectangle diagrams for distributive property
- Use bar diagrams or tape diagrams to represent expressions and their meanings
- Provide number lines with labeled variables for evaluation problems
- Include concrete pictures for real-world contexts
- Show variable definitions clearly (e.g., "Let c = the cost in euros")

**For {{age}} = 13 and {{difficulty}} = medium:**
- Include visual representations for approximately half of tasks, especially new problem types
- Use area models for distributive property when expanding for the first time
- Provide diagrams for geometric problems and patterns
- Allow primarily symbolic notation for straightforward simplification
- Include diagrams for complex real-world setup

**For {{difficulty}} = hard:**
- Use visuals selectively - primarily for verification or complex multi-step problems
- Emphasize symbolic notation and algebraic relationships
- Include diagrams mainly for geometric or pattern-based problems
- Most problems use purely symbolic representation

### Structure of Expression Problems

**For identifying parts of expressions:**
- Circle or box different terms to show what's being combined
- Use different colors or formatting for coefficients vs. variables vs. constants
- Label "like terms" with connecting lines or boxes
- Show the simplified result step-by-step

**For distributive property:**
- For expansion: show the original expression, the "multiplication by each term," and the final result
- Use area models (rectangles with labeled dimensions) when introducing this property
- Show box notation: (a)(b + c) with the box divided
- For factoring: show finding the GCF first, then rewriting

**For evaluation:**
- Show substitution clearly: replace variable with the given value, showing the step clearly
- Include units when applicable
- Show calculation steps, not just the final answer

## Answer Format and Verification

**For expression simplification:**
- Show combining like terms step-by-step
- Identify which terms are being combined and why they can be combined
- Write the simplified expression clearly
- Verify by expanding or evaluating with test values

**For distributive property:**
- Show all steps of expansion or factoring
- For expansion, show: original → multiply by each term → combine → result
- For factoring, show: original → find GCF → rewrite → factored form

**For evaluation:**
- Show substitution: write the expression with values in place of variables
- Show calculation steps with appropriate operational order
- Include units if the context requires them
- Verify by plugging into the original unsimplified expression and comparing results

**For writing expressions:**
- Verify that the expression matches the written description
- Test with example values to confirm the expression makes sense in context
- Check that the expression uses appropriate variables and operations

**Verification strategies to include:**
- For simplification: evaluate both the original and simplified expressions with the same values; results should match
- For distributive property: expand and factor the same expression to verify they're inverses
- For equivalence: find at least two different test values where both expressions give the same result
- For real-world expressions: check that the result makes sense in context (e.g., positive costs, reasonable dimensions)

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design some tasks to specifically challenge these typical errors:

- Confusing variables with specific numbers or thinking a variable always has a particular value
- Writing expressions where order of operations is incorrect (e.g., writing "three times five subtract two" as 3 × 5 - 2 instead of 3(5 - 2))
- Forgetting to include the variable when simplifying terms (e.g., thinking 3x + 2x = 5 instead of 5x)
- Combining unlike terms incorrectly (e.g., 3x + 2y = 5xy or 5x + 2)
- Incorrectly applying the distributive property (e.g., 2(x + 3) = 2x + 3 instead of 2x + 6)
- Using the distributive property when it doesn't apply (e.g., thinking 2(3 × 4) = 6 × 8)
- Failing to distribute negative signs correctly (e.g., -(x - 3) = -x - 3 instead of -x + 3)
- Mishandling negative coefficients (e.g., 3x + (-5x) thinking they're different from 3x - 5x)
- Not understanding that 2x means "two times x" and treating it as a two-letter variable
- Incorrectly evaluating expressions by substituting wrong values or making calculation errors
- Thinking terms can only be combined if they appear consecutively (not recognizing 2x + 3 + 5x = 7x + 3)
- Failing to recognize equivalent expressions in different forms

## Contextual Diversity

Use varied real-world contexts appropriate for Grade 7 students:

- **Money and shopping**: total cost calculations, comparing prices, calculating change, discounts, bulk pricing (cost = number × unit price)
- **Distance and travel**: calculating total distance, finding average speed, time-distance relationships
- **Geometry**: perimeter and area of rectangles and other shapes with variable dimensions, volume of rectangular prisms
- **Ages and time**: age relationships between people, time calculations (Sarah is 3 years older than Miguel; if Miguel's age is m, Sarah's age is m + 3)
- **Sports and scoring**: calculating points, finding averages, comparing records
- **Patterns and sequences**: dot patterns, tile patterns, building patterns that increase by fixed amounts
- **Temperature and measurement**: calculating temperature changes, converting between units with variable values
- **Work and productivity**: calculating earnings based on hours worked, production rates
- **Collections and organizing**: counting items organized in groups, describing collections of objects

Ensure contexts are:
- Age-appropriate and relevant to student interests and experiences
- Realistic in terms of numbers used and situations described
- Free of bias and culturally neutral where possible
- Meaningful for understanding the practical importance of variables and algebraic expressions

## Visual Representation

**When to use visual supports:**
- **Area models**: For understanding the distributive property (showing a rectangle divided into sections)
- **Bar/tape diagrams**: For representing expressions and their meanings, showing relationships between quantities
- **Number lines**: For variable substitution and evaluation problems
- **Arrays and arrangements**: For pattern recognition and finding expressions for the nth term
- **Geometric figures**: For area, perimeter, and volume problems with labeled variables
- **Two-column tables**: For showing pattern sequences and deriving expressions
- **Equation balance diagrams**: For understanding equality when expressions are set equal

**Avoid:**
- Do not show worked examples with specific numbers that students could simply copy
- Do not include templates that students could fill in without understanding
- Do not use overly decorative visuals that distract from mathematics
- Describe visual formats and strategies rather than providing copy-able diagrams

## Key Instructional Emphasis

Tasks should reinforce these fundamental understandings:

- Variables represent unknown or changing quantities; using them allows us to write general rules and solve problems with any values
- Algebraic expressions are meaningful representations of real situations; each part of an expression (terms, coefficients, constants) has a meaning
- Like terms have the same variable raised to the same power; they can be combined because they represent the same type of quantity
- The distributive property is a fundamental property that allows us to multiply a sum (or difference) by a number
- Simplifying expressions means rewriting them in an equivalent but simpler form
- Evaluating an expression means finding its numerical value when variables have specific values
- Different-looking expressions can be equivalent (e.g., 2(x + 3) and 2x + 6 are equivalent), and we can verify this by simplifying or evaluating
- Expressions form the foundation for equations; solving equations builds on manipulating expressions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not create tasks that:
- Use abstract algebraic contexts with no connection to real situations or geometric meaning
- Provide complete worked examples that could be copied rather than understood
- Skip concrete representations and move immediately to symbolic manipulation
- Present variables as mysterious or difficult without clear explanation of their meaning
- Mix too many new concepts in a single task (e.g., introducing both variables and negative numbers for the first time)
- Use inconsistent notation or variable definitions
- Focus exclusively on symbol manipulation without asking students to explain meaning
- Create ambiguous expressions or real-world descriptions that could be interpreted multiple ways
- Neglect to verify that simplification is correct through evaluation
- Present expressions without contexts, treating algebra as purely abstract symbol manipulation
- Use overly complex or unrealistic numbers that obscure the main concept being learned

## Language Considerations

Use precise mathematical vocabulary consistently:

- **Variable** (Variable) - a letter or symbol representing an unknown or changing quantity
- **Expression** (Ausdruck) - a mathematical phrase combining numbers, variables, and operations
- **Term** (Term) - a single number, variable, or product of numbers and variables in an expression
- **Coefficient** (Koeffizient) - the numerical factor in a term (the number multiplied by the variable)
- **Constant** (Konstante) - a term with no variable; a fixed number
- **Like terms** (Ähnliche Terme) - terms with identical variables raised to the same power
- **Simplify** (Vereinfachen) - rewrite an expression in an equivalent but simpler form
- **Combine like terms** (Ähnliche Terme zusammenfassen) - add or subtract the coefficients of like terms
- **Distributive property** (Distributivgesetz) - a(b + c) = ab + ac
- **Expand** (Ausmultiplizieren) - apply the distributive property to multiply through a sum
- **Factor** (Faktorisieren) - write an expression as a product; use the distributive property in reverse
- **Evaluate** (Auswerten) - find the numerical value of an expression by substituting values for variables
- **Equivalent expressions** (Gleichwertige Ausdrücke) - expressions that have the same value for all values of the variables

Define these terms explicitly when introducing new vocabulary and use them consistently throughout all tasks.
