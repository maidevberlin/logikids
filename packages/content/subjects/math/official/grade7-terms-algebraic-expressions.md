learning_objectives:
  - Use variables to represent unknown quantities and generalize patterns
  - Write algebraic expressions to represent real-world situations and mathematical relationships
  - Interpret algebraic expressions and identify terms, coefficients, and like terms
  - Simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms
  - Apply the distributive property to expand and simplify expressions
  - Evaluate algebraic expressions by substituting given values for variables
  - Recognize equivalent expressions and verify equivalence through evaluation
prerequisites:
  - grade4-algebraic-thinking
  - integers-negative-numbers
real_world_context: Variables and algebraic expressions model real-world situations like calculating costs (total cost = quantity × price), managing inventory (remaining items = initial quantity - items sold), finding patterns in sequences, calculating area and perimeter, determining ages or distances, comparing phone plans with different cost structures, calculating sports statistics, and solving practical problems. Grade 7 students encounter algebraic thinking in shopping (comparing deals with variables), sports (scoring patterns), geometry (formulas with variables), and science (distance = speed × time). Mastery of variables and expressions forms the foundation for solving equations, working with functions, and all higher mathematics.
