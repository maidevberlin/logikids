id: grade9-similarity
name: Similarity and Proportionality
description: Understanding triangle similarity criteria, applying the intercept theorem, calculating proportional segments, and analyzing how scaling factors affect area and volume
grade: 9
focus: Geometric similarity and scaling relationships
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Verify triangle similarity using AA, SAS, and SSS criteria
  - Apply the intercept theorem (Strahlensatz) to calculate unknown segment lengths
  - Determine proportional relationships between corresponding segments in similar figures
  - Calculate how scaling by factor k affects area (k²) and volume (k³)
  - Solve practical measurement problems using similarity principles
  - Distinguish between congruence and similarity transformations
problem_types:
  - Similarity criteria identification
  - Intercept theorem calculation
  - Proportional segment determination
  - Scale factor calculation
  - Area scaling application
  - Volume scaling application
  - Measurement problem solving
  - Similar figure construction
  - Multi-step similarity reasoning
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Verify similarity with clearly marked triangles and given side lengths
    - Apply intercept theorem with two parallel lines and complete information
    - Calculate scale factors from corresponding sides in similar triangles
  medium:
    - Determine unknown lengths using similarity ratios in complex diagrams
    - Apply area scaling (k²) to calculate areas after enlargement or reduction
    - Solve problems combining multiple similarity concepts
  hard:
    - Prove similarity relationships in geometric configurations without explicit markings
    - Apply volume scaling (k³) in three-dimensional contexts
    - Solve multi-step problems involving nested similar triangles or composite figures
prerequisites:
  - grade7-proportionality
  - grade7-congruence-triangles
real_world_context:
  - Architects use similarity to create scale models of buildings before construction
  - Photographers adjust image sizes while maintaining proportions using similarity principles
  - Surveyors measure inaccessible distances using similar triangles and known measurements
  - Map makers apply scaling relationships where distance on map relates to real distance
  - Engineers analyze how doubling dimensions affects material needed (area) or capacity (volume)
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid assuming triangles are similar without verifying criteria
  - Do not confuse congruence with similarity (same shape vs same size)
  - Avoid applying linear scale factor to area or volume directly
  - Do not present diagrams where parallel lines are unclear or unmarked
  - Avoid problems requiring trigonometry beyond Grade 9 level
