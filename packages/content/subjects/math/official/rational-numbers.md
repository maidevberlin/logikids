# Rational Numbers Tasks

Create mathematics problems that help students work confidently with fractions, decimals, and negative numbers. Problems should build understanding of how rational numbers extend the number system, how to perform operations with them, and how they appear in everyday contexts.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Number line ordering**: Place rational numbers on a number line, compare and order mixed positive/negative numbers, fractions, and decimals
- **Addition and subtraction with negative numbers**: Calculate expressions like $-8 + 5$, $3 - (-7)$, $-4 - 6$ using the number line and sign rules
- **Multiplication and division with signs**: Apply sign rules (Vorzeichenregeln) for products and quotients: $(-3) \times 5$, $(-12) \div (-4)$, $7 \times (-2)$
- **Operations with fractions**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions like $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{6}$, $\frac{3}{4} \times \frac{8}{9}$, $\frac{5}{6} \div \frac{2}{3}$
- **Mixed operations**: Combine different types of numbers in one expression: $0.5 + \frac{1}{4} - (-0.25)$
- **Order of operations with rational numbers**: Evaluate expressions respecting PEMDAS/BODMAS with negative numbers and fractions: $-2 + 3 \times (-4)$, $(-5)^2 - 8 \div 2$
- **Conversion problems**: Convert between fractions, decimals, and percentages: $\frac{3}{8}$ to decimal, $0.35$ to fraction and percentage, $75\%$ to fraction
- **Word problems**: Real-world scenarios involving temperature changes (from $-5°C$ to $3°C$), bank balances (overdraft), elevation changes (above/below sea level)

**Vary the content/context:**
- **Temperature**: Calculating temperature changes, comparing temperatures below and above zero, weather data analysis
- **Finance**: Bank account balances with overdrafts, profit and loss calculations, debt and credit
- **Geography**: Elevation relative to sea level, depth below water surface, altitude changes
- **Cooking**: Recipe scaling using fractions, ingredient proportions, measuring conversions
- **Sports**: Golf scores (above/below par), swimming pool depths, game point differentials
- **Time zones**: Calculating time differences across zones, forward and backward in time

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 13): Focus on number line visualization, simple addition/subtraction with small negative numbers ($-10$ to $10$), basic fraction operations with common denominators, clear sign rules with examples
- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 13-14): Include all four operations with negative numbers, fraction operations requiring different denominators, mixed numbers and improper fractions, two-step problems combining operations, conversion practice
- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 14): Complex multi-step expressions, combined fractions/decimals/negatives in one problem, order of operations with multiple steps, word problems requiring setup from context, mental math strategies

**Use appropriate formats:**

**LaTeX for formulas:**
- Inline for operations: Calculate $-3 + 7 - (-5)$, Simplify $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{6}$
- Block for multi-step solutions:

$$-2 \times (5 - 8) = -2 \times (-3) = 6$$

$$\frac{3}{4} + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{9}{12} + \frac{10}{12} = \frac{19}{12} = 1\frac{7}{12}$$

**Tables for number comparisons:**

| Number | Decimal | Fraction | Percentage |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| Three quarters | 0.75 | $\frac{3}{4}$ | 75% |
| Half | 0.5 | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 50% |

**SVG diagrams for number lines:**

Use SVG to visualize:
- Number lines showing positive and negative numbers with zero marked
- Movement along number line for addition/subtraction visualization
- Fraction positions on number line between integers
- Temperature scales, elevation diagrams

Example SVG for number line:
```svg

```

**Adjust difficulty with {{difficulty}}:**
- **Easy**: Single operation, small numbers ($-10$ to $10$), fractions with denominators up to 12, clear sign patterns, number line available, direct conversions
- **Medium**: Two operations combined, larger numbers ($-50$ to $50$), fractions requiring finding common denominators, mixed positive/negative expressions, some mental math required
- **Hard**: Multi-step expressions, order of operations essential, combined fractions/decimals/negatives, word problems requiring translation to mathematical expressions, complex conversions

**Include variety in numerical values:**
- Different negative numbers: $-3$, $-15$, $-0.5$, $-\frac{2}{3}$
- Vary fractions: $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{5}{8}$, $\frac{7}{12}$, $\frac{2}{5}$
- Mix decimals: $0.25$, $0.6$, $-1.5$, $2.75$
- Temperature ranges: $-12°C$ to $25°C$
- Elevation ranges: $-50m$ (below sea level) to $500m$ (above)
- Money amounts: $-\$25$ (debt), $\$150$ (credit)
- Ensure answers vary to prevent pattern memorization
