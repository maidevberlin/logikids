# Addition and Subtraction up to 1000 Tasks

Create problems that help students develop mental arithmetic strategies, estimation skills, and fluency with three-digit addition and subtraction.

**Vary the problem structure:**

1. **Addition Without Crossing Hundreds:**
   - Simple three-digit addition: "${{num1}} + {{num2}} = \text{?}$" (e.g., $234 + 125$)
   - Word problems: "{{name}} collected ${{num1}}$ stamps. Then collected ${{num2}}$ more. How many total?"
   - Missing addend: "${{num}} + \text{?} = {{sum}}$"

2. **Addition With Crossing Hundreds:**
   - Crossing one hundred: "${{num1}} + {{num2}} = \text{?}$" (e.g., $467 + 158$)
   - Breaking down: "To solve ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$, add hundreds, tens, and ones separately"
   - Multiple crossings: "${{num1}} + {{num2}} + {{num3}} = \text{?}$"

3. **Subtraction Without Crossing Hundreds:**
   - Basic subtraction: "${{num1}} - {{num2}} = \text{?}$" (e.g., $576 - 234$)
   - Word problems: "A school has ${{total}}$ students. ${{num}}$ are on a field trip. How many remain?"
   - Finding difference: "What is the difference between ${{num1}}$ and ${{num2}}$?"

4. **Subtraction With Crossing Hundreds:**
   - Crossing backward: "${{num1}} - {{num2}} = \text{?}$" (e.g., $512 - 287$)
   - Regrouping strategy: "Solve ${{num1}} - {{num2}}$ by regrouping from hundreds to tens"
   - Checking with addition: "Solve ${{num1}} - {{num2}}$ and verify using addition"

5. **Estimation Strategies:**
   - Round to nearest hundred: "Estimate ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$ by rounding to hundreds"
   - Round to nearest ten: "Estimate ${{num1}} - {{num2}}$ by rounding to tens"
   - Is the estimate reasonable?: "Is ${{estimate}}$ a good estimate for ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$? Why or why not?"
   - Before and after: "Estimate first, then calculate exactly: ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$"

6. **Complement to 1000:**
   - Make 1000: "${{num}} + \text{?} = 1000$"
   - From 1000: "$1000 - {{num}} = \text{?}$"
   - Word problems: "{{name}} is saving for a $1000$ bike. They have ${{saved}}$. How much more needed?"

7. **Advanced Calculation Strategies:**
   - Break into place values: "${{num1}} + {{num2}}$ = $({{h1}} + {{h2}}) + ({{t1}} + {{t2}}) + ({{o1}} + {{o2}})$"
   - Compensation method: "Solve ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$ by rounding to a friendly number, then adjusting"
   - Number line jumps: "Start at ${{num1}}$, jump by $+{{hundreds}}$, then $+{{tens}}$, then $+{{ones}}$"
   - Equal differences: "Solve ${{num1}} - {{num2}}$ by changing both numbers by the same amount"

8. **Mixed Operations and Complex Problems:**
   - Three numbers: "${{num1}} + {{num2}} - {{num3}} = \text{?}$"
   - Multi-step word problems: "{{name}} had ${{start}}$ marbles, won ${{won}}$ in a game, gave away ${{gave}}$, then found ${{found}}$. How many now?"
   - Comparison problems: "Town A has ${{pop1}}$ people, Town B has ${{pop2}}$ people. How many more people in Town A?"
   - Money problems: "You have ${{amount1}}$ cents and earn ${{amount2}}$ more. You buy something for ${{cost}}$ cents. How much left?"

**Estimation benchmarks:**
| Number Range | Round to |
|--------------|----------|
| $450-549$    | $500$    |
| $1-49$       | $0$      |
| $51-99$      | $100$    |

**Mental math strategies to emphasize:**
- Break numbers by place value (hundreds, tens, ones)
- Use compensation (round then adjust)
- Find friendly numbers (multiples of 100)
- Use number line visualization
- Apply inverse operations for checking
- Estimate before calculating

**Problem difficulty levels:**
- Easy: No regrouping needed (e.g., $234 + 125$)
- Medium: One regrouping (e.g., $456 + 78$)
- Hard: Multiple regroupings (e.g., $567 + 298$)
