grade: 4
ages:
  - 9
  - 10
focus: Geometric constructions and spatial reasoning
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Construct geometric figures accurately using ruler, compass, and set square
  - Apply geometric transformations including translation, reflection, and rotation
  - Identify and create nets of three-dimensional solids
  - Calculate area and perimeter of rectangles and volume of cuboids
  - Understand relationships between perimeter and area through investigation
  - Recognize and describe symmetry properties in geometric figures
prerequisites:
  - grade3-geometric-figures
  - grade3-area
real_world_context: Geometric constructions are fundamental to architecture, engineering, design, and spatial planning. Understanding transformations helps in pattern recognition, art, and navigation. Nets and solids connect to packaging design, building structures, and understanding three-dimensional space.
