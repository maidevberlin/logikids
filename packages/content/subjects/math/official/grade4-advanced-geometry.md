# Advanced Geometry - Task Generation Guidelines

Generate tasks that develop spatial visualization, precise construction skills, and geometric reasoning. The task generator should create problems that require students to work with geometric tools, understand transformations, and connect two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations.

## Problem Type Variations

The task generator should create diverse problem structures:

1. **Construction Tasks**: Ask students to construct specific geometric figures (perpendicular lines, parallel lines, angles, triangles, rectangles) using specified tools and following given constraints

2. **Transformation Problems**: Present a figure and ask students to predict or describe the result of applying one or more transformations, or to identify which transformation was applied

3. **Net and Solid Matching**: Show either a net or a solid and ask students to identify its corresponding form, or determine if a given net can fold into a specific solid

4. **Measurement Investigations**: Pose problems where students must calculate area, perimeter, or volume, and explore relationships between these measurements

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: Present figures and ask students to identify lines of symmetry, complete symmetric patterns, or create symmetric designs

6. **Spatial Reasoning**: Describe a three-dimensional arrangement and ask students to identify views from different perspectives or count specific elements

7. **Comparison Tasks**: Present multiple figures or solids and ask students to compare properties, measurements, or transformation effects

8. **Reverse Construction**: Describe properties of a figure and ask students to determine what construction steps or tools are needed to create it

9. **Pattern Extension**: Show a sequence of geometric transformations or constructions and ask students to continue the pattern or identify the rule

10. **Real-World Applications**: Present practical scenarios requiring geometric constructions, such as designing layouts, creating patterns, or planning arrangements

## Age-Based Complexity

For students at {{age}}:

- **Age 9**: Focus on single-step constructions, simple transformations (one type at a time), basic rectangles and cuboids, straightforward nets of familiar solids like cubes and rectangular prisms. Use concrete descriptions and visual support. Calculations involve whole numbers with single-digit or simple two-digit values.

- **Age 10**: Include multi-step constructions, combined transformations (applying two transformations sequentially), variety of quadrilaterals and composite shapes, more complex nets including pyramids and cylinders. Introduce abstract reasoning about properties. Calculations may involve larger numbers and require multiple steps.

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy
- Direct construction of single geometric element (one perpendicular line, one parallel line, one specific angle)
- Single transformation clearly described
- Standard nets of cubes or rectangular prisms
- Area or perimeter calculation with all measurements provided
- Identifying obvious symmetry in simple figures
- Volume calculation for cuboids with unit dimensions

### Medium
- Multi-step constructions combining several elements
- Sequential transformations or identifying unknown transformation
- Nets of pyramids or cylinders, or matching unfamiliar nets to solids
- Problems requiring students to find missing measurements before calculating
- Creating symmetric patterns or analyzing complex symmetry
- Volume calculations requiring unit conversions or working with composite solids

### Hard
- Complex geometric constructions with multiple constraints
- Transformation chains involving three or more operations
- Analyzing impossible nets or designing custom nets for specifications
- Investigation tasks exploring relationships between measurements
- Proving or explaining symmetry properties
- Multi-step volume and area problems with real-world constraints

## Format and Presentation Guidance

### When to Use Diagrams
- Construction tasks: Describe the starting configuration or constraints, not the solution steps
- Transformation tasks: Show the original figure and describe the transformation type
- Net tasks: Present either the net or the solid, asking students to work with the other form
- Symmetry tasks: Show incomplete patterns or figures for analysis

### When to Use Tables
- Comparing multiple figures or solids and their properties
- Recording measurements before and after transformations
- Organizing data for investigation tasks about measurement relationships

### Visual Elements
Diagrams should show geometric figures in various orientations, not always aligned with coordinate axes. Include grid backgrounds when appropriate for counting or measuring. Use different scales to develop flexible spatial reasoning.

## Numerical Variation Principles

Vary measurements across different scales and contexts:

- **Length measurements**: Use diverse units (millimeters to meters) and vary magnitudes from very small (single-digit millimeters) to large (double-digit meters)
- **Area calculations**: Include squares, non-square rectangles with various aspect ratios, and composite figures
- **Volume calculations**: Vary dimensions independently to create cubes, elongated prisms, and flat boxes
- **Angle measurements**: Use common angles (right angles, angles in regular polygons) and also non-standard angles requiring precise construction
- **Counting elements**: When asking about edges, vertices, or faces, use solids with varying complexity

Randomize which measurements are given and which must be calculated or inferred. Avoid repeatedly using the same number combinations.

## Construction Tool Specification

Vary which tools are required or allowed:

- Ruler only (for drawing straight lines and measuring)
- Compass and ruler (for circles, arcs, and perpendicular bisectors)
- Set square and ruler (for right angles and parallel lines)
- All tools available (for complex constructions)

Specify whether measurements must be exact or can be estimated. For younger students, provide more guidance about which tool to use for each step.

## Transformation Combinations

When working with transformations:

- Single transformations for {{difficulty}} easy: one reflection, one translation, or one rotation
- Combined transformations for {{difficulty}} medium: two transformations in sequence
- Complex transformation chains for {{difficulty}} hard: three or more transformations or analyzing transformation equivalence

Vary the axis or center of transformations, the direction and magnitude of translations, and the angle of rotations.

## Connection to Curriculum Standards

Tasks should address KMK Bildungsstandards for Primarbereich Mathematik:

- Spatial visualization and reasoning about plans and multiple perspectives
- Identifying and sorting geometric bodies and planar figures by properties
- Constructing models through building, arranging, and folding
- Creating technical and freehand drawings
- Recognizing geometric mappings and symmetry properties
- Comparing areas through decomposition and measuring with unit squares
- Investigating perimeter-area relationships
- Comparing volumes using unit cubes

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not always start constructions from the same position or orientation
- Avoid using only squares when rectangles are appropriate
- Do not limit transformations to simple horizontal or vertical reflections
- Avoid always providing figures in standard orientation on coordinate grids
- Do not use only unit cubes when discussing volume
- Avoid exclusively using perfect cubes when cuboids are the topic
- Do not always ask for the same measurement (vary between asking for area, perimeter, missing side, or volume)

## Language and Context

Use age-appropriate language that balances mathematical precision with accessibility. For {{age}} 9, use more concrete descriptions with familiar objects. For {{age}} 10, introduce more formal geometric terminology while maintaining clarity.

Connect to real-world contexts: designing rooms or gardens (area and perimeter), packaging (nets and volume), art and patterns (symmetry and transformations), building and construction (geometric constructions with tools).

Generate tasks in {{language}} with appropriate mathematical terminology for that language. Ensure all instructions are clear and unambiguous.
