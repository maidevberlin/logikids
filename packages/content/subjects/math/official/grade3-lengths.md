# Lengths

Generate tasks that help students understand length units (mm, cm, m, km) and convert between them confidently.

## Task Variations

### 1. Understanding the Kilometer
Introduce the kilometer unit:
- "A kilometer (km) is 1,000 meters. It's used for long distances."
- "Which would you measure in kilometers: the length of your pencil or the distance to the next town?"
- Real-world examples:
  - "A car trip might be 50 km"
  - "A marathon is about 42 km"
  - "The distance between two cities"
- Comparison questions: "What's longer: 1 km or 500 m?"

### 2. Unit Relationships and Reference Points
Establish understanding of all four units:
- Create a reference table:

| Unit       | Equals           | Example                          |
|------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Millimeter (mm) | Small measure    | Thickness of a coin (2 mm)      |
| Centimeter (cm) | 10 mm            | Width of your finger (1-2 cm)   |
| Meter (m)       | 100 cm           | Height of a door (2 m)          |
| Kilometer (km)  | 1,000 m          | Walk to school (1-2 km)         |

- "Name something that is about 1 cm long, 1 m long, and 1 km long"
- "Which unit would you use to measure: a book's thickness? a room's length? a bike ride?"

### 3. Converting Centimeters to Millimeters
Practice cm → mm conversions:
- Rule: Multiply by 10 (1 cm = 10 mm)
- "{{length}} cm = ? mm"
- Examples with varying difficulty:
  - $5 \text{ cm} = 50 \text{ mm}$
  - $12 \text{ cm} = 120 \text{ mm}$
  - $7.5 \text{ cm} = 75 \text{ mm}$
- Show calculation: $8 \text{ cm} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ mm}$

### 4. Converting Millimeters to Centimeters
Practice mm → cm conversions:
- Rule: Divide by 10 (10 mm = 1 cm)
- "{{length}} mm = ? cm"
- Examples:
  - $30 \text{ mm} = 3 \text{ cm}$
  - $125 \text{ mm} = 12.5 \text{ cm}$
  - $80 \text{ mm} = 8 \text{ cm}$
- Word problems: "A ribbon is 65 mm long. How many centimeters is that?"

### 5. Converting Meters to Centimeters
Practice m → cm conversions:
- Rule: Multiply by 100 (1 m = 100 cm)
- "{{length}} m = ? cm"
- Examples:
  - $2 \text{ m} = 200 \text{ cm}$
  - $5 \text{ m} = 500 \text{ cm}$
  - $3.5 \text{ m} = 350 \text{ cm}$
- Context: "A rope is 4 m long. How many centimeters?"
- Show: $6 \text{ m} = 6 \times 100 = 600 \text{ cm}$

### 6. Converting Centimeters to Meters
Practice cm → m conversions:
- Rule: Divide by 100 (100 cm = 1 m)
- "{{length}} cm = ? m"
- Examples:
  - $300 \text{ cm} = 3 \text{ m}$
  - $450 \text{ cm} = 4.5 \text{ m}$
  - $820 \text{ cm} = 8.2 \text{ m}$
- "A hallway is 650 cm long. How many meters is that?"

### 7. Converting Kilometers to Meters
Practice km → m conversions:
- Rule: Multiply by 1,000 (1 km = 1,000 m)
- "{{distance}} km = ? m"
- Examples:
  - $2 \text{ km} = 2{,}000 \text{ m}$
  - $5 \text{ km} = 5{,}000 \text{ m}$
  - $3.5 \text{ km} = 3{,}500 \text{ m}$
- "A running track is 2 km long. How many meters?"
- Show: $4 \text{ km} = 4 \times 1{,}000 = 4{,}000 \text{ m}$

### 8. Converting Meters to Kilometers
Practice m → km conversions:
- Rule: Divide by 1,000 (1,000 m = 1 km)
- "{{distance}} m = ? km"
- Examples:
  - $3{,}000 \text{ m} = 3 \text{ km}$
  - $5{,}500 \text{ m} = 5.5 \text{ km}$
  - $1{,}200 \text{ m} = 1.2 \text{ km}$
- "A bike path is 4,500 m long. How many kilometers?"

### 9. Multi-Step Conversions
Combine multiple conversion steps:
- "Convert 2.5 km to centimeters" (km → m → cm)
  - $2.5 \text{ km} = 2{,}500 \text{ m} = 250{,}000 \text{ cm}$
- "Convert 35,000 mm to meters" (mm → cm → m)
  - $35{,}000 \text{ mm} = 3{,}500 \text{ cm} = 35 \text{ m}$
- "How many millimeters are in 1.2 m?"
  - $1.2 \text{ m} = 120 \text{ cm} = 1{,}200 \text{ mm}$

### 10. Length Word Problems
Apply conversions in context:
- "Sarah walks 750 m to school. Her friend walks 1 km. Who walks farther and by how much?"
- "A piece of wood is 2.5 m long. You cut off 80 cm. How much is left in meters?"
- "A rope is 15 m long. You need pieces that are 50 cm each. How many pieces can you cut?"
- "The distance from home to the park is 3.2 km. If you've walked 1,800 m, how much farther in meters?"

### 11. Comparison Problems
Compare lengths in different units:
- "Which is longer: 3 km or 2,500 m?"
- "Order from shortest to longest: 350 cm, 4 m, 3,200 mm"
- "Is 2.5 m greater than or less than 280 cm?"
- Create comparison tables:

| Length A | Length B | Which is longer? |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| 5 m      | 450 cm   | ?                |
| 2.5 km   | 3,000 m  | ?                |
| 80 mm    | 9 cm     | ?                |

### 12. Adding and Subtracting Mixed Units
Perform operations across units:
- "Add 2 m 35 cm + 1 m 80 cm" (convert or keep mixed)
  - Method 1: $235 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm} = 415 \text{ cm} = 4 \text{ m } 15 \text{ cm}$
  - Method 2: $2 \text{ m} + 1 \text{ m} = 3 \text{ m}$; $35 \text{ cm} + 80 \text{ cm} = 115 \text{ cm} = 1 \text{ m } 15 \text{ cm}$; total = $4 \text{ m } 15 \text{ cm}$
- "Subtract 5 m - 240 cm"
  - $500 \text{ cm} - 240 \text{ cm} = 260 \text{ cm} = 2.6 \text{ m}$

## Difficulty Scaling

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy):**
- Single-step conversions with whole numbers
- mm ↔ cm or m ↔ cm
- Small numbers (under 20)
- Direct conversion only
- Example: "7 cm = ? mm"

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium):**
- km ↔ m conversions
- Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.5 m, 2.5 km)
- Simple word problems requiring one conversion
- Comparison of different units
- Example: "Which is longer: 2.5 km or 2,800 m?"

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard):**
- Multi-step conversions (mm → cm → m or km → m → cm)
- Complex word problems with multiple operations
- Adding/subtracting mixed units
- Large numbers and decimals
- Ordering multiple lengths in different units
- Example: "A hiking trail is 4.2 km. You've hiked 1,850 m. How many meters remain? Express answer in both m and km."
