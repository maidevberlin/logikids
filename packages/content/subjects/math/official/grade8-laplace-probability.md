id: grade8-laplace-probability
name: Laplace Experiments
description: Random experiments, Laplace formula P(E)=|E|/|Ω|, counting principles, tree diagrams for multi-stage experiments, relative frequency, law of large numbers
grade: 8
focus: Probability theory and statistical thinking
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Distinguish random experiments from deterministic processes using correct terminology
  - Calculate relative frequencies from experimental data and understand the law of large numbers
  - Identify Laplace experiments and apply the formula P(E) = |E|/|Ω| to calculate probabilities
  - Apply systematic counting principles to determine the number of possible outcomes
  - Use tree diagrams to analyze multi-stage experiments with and without replacement
  - Determine probabilities of compound events using tree diagrams and counting methods
  - Model real-world situations involving randomness with appropriate probability concepts
problem_types:
  - Single-stage coin/die probability
  - Relative frequency calculation
  - Counting outcomes
  - Multi-stage tree diagram
  - With/without replacement
  - Compound event probability
  - Real-world probability modeling
  - Sample space determination
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-stage experiments with small sample spaces (≤12 outcomes)
    - Simple relative frequency calculations from given data
    - Basic tree diagrams with 2 stages and 2-3 branches per stage
  medium:
    - Two-stage experiments requiring systematic counting
    - Compound events requiring multiple conditions
    - Tree diagrams with 3 stages or varied branch counts
  hard:
    - Three-stage experiments with replacement considerations
    - Complex compound events requiring combination of methods
    - Problems requiring both counting principles and tree diagrams
real_world_context:
  - Weather forecasting uses probability to predict rain, temperature, and storm likelihood
  - Game developers use probability to design fair games and balanced random mechanics
  - Quality control in manufacturing relies on sampling and probability to detect defects
  - Medical testing interprets probabilities to assess disease risk and test accuracy
  - Sports analysts use probability models to predict game outcomes and player performance
prerequisites:
  - grade4-data-probability
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid conditional probability or Bayes' theorem beyond simple contexts
  - Don't use sample spaces larger than 100 outcomes without structure
  - Avoid probability calculations requiring binomial coefficients
  - Don't introduce geometric or continuous probability distributions
  - Avoid formal set theory notation beyond basic union/intersection
