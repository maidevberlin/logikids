name: Written Multiplication and Division
description: Mastering standard written algorithms for multi-digit multiplication and division; understanding when to apply each operation; solving real-world problems
grade: 4
focus: Written calculation methods for multiplication and division
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Apply the standard written algorithm for multiplying multi-digit numbers by one-digit numbers
  - Apply the standard written algorithm for multiplying multi-digit numbers by two-digit numbers
  - Apply the standard written algorithm for dividing multi-digit numbers by one-digit divisors
  - Interpret remainders in division problems contextually
  - Estimate products and quotients to check reasonableness of answers
  - Solve multi-step word problems requiring multiplication or division
problem_types:
  - Written multiplication setup
  - Written division setup
  - Product calculation
  - Quotient calculation
  - Remainder interpretation
  - Estimation verification
  - Missing factor problems
  - Word problem application
  - Error detection
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Three-digit by one-digit multiplication (e.g., 234 × 5)
    - Two-digit by two-digit multiplication (e.g., 23 × 14)
    - Division with single-digit divisors, no remainder (e.g., 156 ÷ 6)
  medium:
    - Four-digit by one-digit multiplication (e.g., 2,345 × 7)
    - Three-digit by two-digit multiplication (e.g., 234 × 56)
    - Division with single-digit divisors, with remainder (e.g., 175 ÷ 8)
  hard:
    - Four-digit by two-digit multiplication (e.g., 1,234 × 45)
    - Division requiring multiple steps and careful regrouping
    - Multi-step word problems combining both operations
prerequisites:
  - grade3-multiplication-tables
  - grade3-multiplication-division-strategies
  - grade3-written-addition-and-subtraction
real_world_context:
  - Calculating total cost when buying multiple items at the same price
  - Dividing items equally among groups (party favors, classroom supplies)
  - Computing distances for repeated trips (daily commute times number of days)
  - Determining how many containers needed to pack a given quantity
  - Calculating area of rectangular spaces (floor tiles, garden plots)
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid divisors larger than 9 (two-digit division is grade 5+)
  - Don't mix written algorithms with mental math in the same problem
  - Avoid products exceeding 1,000,000
  - Don't introduce decimals in division (remainders only, no decimal quotients)
  - Avoid problems where remainder interpretation is ambiguous
