# Two-Way Table

Create tasks where {{child_name}} creates, completes, and interprets two-way tables (cross-tabulation) appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Creating Two-Way Tables**: Organize data into a two-way table. "Survey: {{20}} students, {{12}} are girls, {{8}} are boys. {{15}} prefer math, {{5}} prefer art. {{8}} girls prefer math. Create a two-way table." Structure:

|  | Math | Art | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Girls | {{8}} | ? | {{12}} |
| Boys | ? | ? | {{8}} |
| Total | {{15}} | {{5}} | {{20}} |

Students complete missing cells using addition/subtraction.

2. **Completing Two-Way Tables**: Given partial information, fill in missing values. Provide {{4-6}} of {{9}} cells and ask students to find the rest. Use totals to determine missing values. Vary which cells are given and which must be calculated.

3. **Reading Two-Way Tables**: Extract information from completed tables. "This table shows favorite sports by gender. How many {{boys}} prefer {{soccer}}?" or "How many students total were surveyed?" Include questions about specific cells and about totals.

4. **Calculating Probabilities from Tables**: Find probabilities using two-way tables. "What is the probability a randomly selected student is a {{girl who prefers math}}?" If table shows {{8}} out of {{20}} total, answer is $\frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5} = 40\\%$.

5. **Conditional Probability (Intuitive)**: Find probability given a condition. "Given a student prefers math, what is the probability they are a girl?" From table: {{8}} girls prefer math out of {{15}} total who prefer math, so $\frac{8}{15} \approx 53\\%$. Emphasize selecting from a subset, not the whole.

6. **Comparing Categories**: Use tables to compare groups. "Do more {{boys}} or {{girls}} prefer {{art}}?" or "Which subject is more popular overall?" Requires reading and comparing different cells or row/column totals.

7. **Real-World Survey Data**: Present realistic scenarios. "Survey of {{60}} people about exercise and diet. {{35}} exercise regularly, {{40}} eat healthy, {{25}} do both. Complete the two-way table." Structure with "Exercise/Not Exercise" vs. "Healthy Diet/Not Healthy".

8. **Multi-Category Tables**: Use tables with {{3×3}} or {{2×4}} dimensions. "{{75}} students surveyed about favorite season (Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter) by grade ({{5}}/{{6}}). Grade 5: {{20}} Spring, {{10}} Summer, {{8}} Fall, {{7}} Winter..." Larger tables require careful organization.

Present standard two-way table format:

|  | Category A | Category B | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Group 1 | cell value | cell value | row total |
| Group 2 | cell value | cell value | row total |
| Total | column total | column total | grand total |

Key concepts:
- **Row Totals**: Sum across each row
- **Column Totals**: Sum down each column
- **Grand Total**: Sum of all entries (appears in bottom-right)
- **Joint Frequency**: Value in a cell (e.g., "girls who prefer math")
- **Marginal Frequency**: Row or column totals
- **Conditional Probability**: Probability within a subset (e.g., "given the student is a girl...")

Provide step-by-step approach:
1. Read the problem carefully
2. Set up table structure with labels
3. Fill in given information
4. Use totals to find missing cells
5. Check: all rows and columns should sum correctly

Include verification questions: "Add up all the cells. Does it equal the grand total?" Help students see relationships: if row total is {{12}} and one cell is {{8}}, other cell must be {{12 - 8 = 4}}.

Use realistic contexts: pet ownership by grade, favorite food by age group, transportation method by distance from school, sport preference by season. Keep numbers manageable (totals {{20-100}}) and ensure data is consistent (all totals must match).
