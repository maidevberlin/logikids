  - Solve equations with variables on both sides
  - Translate word problems into algebraic equations
  - Verify solutions by substitution
  - Apply linear equations to real-world contexts
  - Understand the concept of equivalence and balance in equations
prerequisites:

  - natural-numbers-operations
  - fraction-operations
  - integers-negative-numbers
real_world_context: Calculating costs and prices, determining ages or distances, solving budget problems, finding unknown quantities in commerce, measuring temperature changes, calculating speed and distance, determining average rates, working with discounts and markups, understanding financial planning
problem_types:
  - One-step addition/subtraction
  - One-step multiplication/division
  - Two-step equations
  - Variables both sides
  - Equations with parentheses
  - Equations with fractions
  - Equations with decimals
  - Word problems
  - Solution verification
  - Number patterns
age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Focus on one-step and simple two-step equations
    - Use smaller integer coefficients and constants
    - Emphasize concrete balance and inverse operation thinking
    - Provide more scaffolding with step-by-step templates
    - Use familiar real-world contexts (pocket money, lunch costs, simple shopping)
    - Avoid complex fractions; use halves and quarters if fractions are included
    - Include visual representations of balance (scales, balanced diagrams described in text)
  13:
    - Include complex two-step equations and variables on both sides
    - Use larger coefficients and both positive and negative integers
    - Introduce equations with fractions and decimals
    - Require more complex word problem translation
    - Include multi-step real-world scenarios
    - Expect fluency with distributive property and simplification
    - Challenge with non-routine problems requiring problem-solving strategies
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Predominantly one-step equations with positive integers
    - Clear, direct word problems with obvious operations
    - Simple variable on one side only
    - Numbers small and familiar (under 30)
    - Single-operation required to solve
    - Verification examples with clear right/wrong answers
    - Real-world contexts highly familiar and concrete
  medium:
    - Mix of one-step and two-step equations
    - Equations with variables on both sides (simple cases)
    - Positive and negative integers
    - Some simple fractions and decimals
    - Word problems requiring careful reading and translation
    - Multi-step reasoning within the context
    - Numbers in reasonable ranges (up to 100)
    - Some parentheses or distributive property needed
  hard:
    - Complex two-step and multi-step equations
    - Variables on both sides with more complex coefficients
    - Equations with fractions and decimals throughout
    - Parentheses and distributive property applications
    - Complex word problems requiring interpretation and decision-making
    - Non-routine problems with multiple solution pathways
    - Equations that simplify to identities or contradictions (no solution/infinite solutions)
    - Word problems with extraneous or constraint information

version_notes: Migrated to frontmatter-based format. Extracted problem_types (10 items covering equation solving variations), age_guidelines (threshold at 13 for increased complexity), and difficulty_guidelines (easy/medium/hard arrays). Prose content removed as all guidance now structured in frontmatter.
