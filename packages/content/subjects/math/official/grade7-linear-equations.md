id: grade7-linear-equations
name: Linear Equations
description: Solving linear equations in one variable using equivalent transformations and the balance principle, including equations with brackets, multi-step equations, and simple inequalities
grade: 7
focus: Solving linear equations through equivalent transformations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Set up linear equations from word problems using variables and the balance principle
  - Solve linear equations through systematic equivalent transformations
  - Verify solutions by substituting back into the original equation
  - Compare and evaluate different solution strategies for the same equation
  - Interpret and reflect on the reasonableness of solutions in real-world contexts
  - Solve simple linear inequalities of the form ax + b < c
  - Identify when an equation has no solution or infinitely many solutions
problem_types:
  - One-step equation
  - Two-step equation
  - Multi-step equation
  - Equation with brackets
  - Equation with variable on both sides
  - Word problem setup
  - Solution verification
  - Simple inequality
  - No solution or infinite solutions
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - One-step equations (ax = b or x + a = b) with integer coefficients
    - Two-step equations requiring at most two transformations
    - Solutions are integers between -20 and 20
  medium:
    - Equations with brackets requiring distributive property
    - Equations with variables on both sides requiring collection of like terms
    - Two-step word problems requiring equation setup and solving
  hard:
    - Multi-step equations combining brackets and variables on both sides
    - Complex word problems requiring translation to equations
    - Equations that simplify to 0 = 0 or contradictions like 3 = 5
prerequisites:
  - grade4-patterns-equations
  - grade6-rational-addition-subtraction
  - grade6-rational-multiplication-division

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid equations requiring fraction operations beyond simple halves or thirds
  - Don't use decimal coefficients smaller than 0.1 or larger than 100
  - Avoid word problems with ambiguous or multiple valid interpretations
  - Don't introduce quadratic equations or equations with squared variables
  - Avoid problems combining equation solving with complex geometry formulas
