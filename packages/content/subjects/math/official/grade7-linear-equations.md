# Linear Equations

Generate tasks that help students develop proficiency in solving linear equations with one variable, understanding the balance method, and applying algebraic reasoning to real-world situations.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse problem types testing different aspects of equation solving:

1. **One-Step Equations (Addition/Subtraction)**: Solve equations where you add or subtract the same value on both sides, such as "x plus 7 equals 15" or "x minus 3 equals 12", where x is the variable. Include both positive and negative integers. Emphasize that doing the same operation to both sides keeps the equation balanced.

2. **One-Step Equations (Multiplication/Division)**: Solve equations where you multiply or divide both sides by the same value, such as "3 times x equals 18" or "x divided by 2 equals 5". Include whole numbers and simple fractions. For division equations, include cases where the divisor is both greater than and less than 1.

3. **Two-Step Equations**: Solve equations combining two operations, such as "2 times x plus 3 equals 11" or "(x minus 5) divided by 2 equals 3". Require students to identify which operation to undo first (typically addition/subtraction, then multiplication/division).

4. **Variables on Both Sides**: Solve equations where the variable appears on both sides, such as "3x plus 2 equals x plus 10". Require students to collect like terms and demonstrate understanding that variables can be moved to either side of the equation.

5. **Equations with Parentheses**: Solve equations like "2 times (x plus 3) equals 12" or "3x plus 2(x plus 4) equals 20". Require application of the distributive property before solving.

6. **Equations with Fractions**: Solve equations where coefficients or constants are fractions, such as "x divided by 3 plus 2 equals 5" or "(2x plus 3) divided by 4 equals 5". Include both simple halves/thirds and more complex fractions.

7. **Equations with Decimals**: Solve equations with decimal coefficients and constants. Demonstrate the relationship between decimal and fraction representations.

8. **Translate and Solve Word Problems**: Present real-world scenarios requiring students to:
   - Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable
   - Extract relevant numerical information
   - Translate English phrases to algebraic expressions
   - Set up the equation
   - Solve and verify the solution makes sense in context

9. **Solution Verification**: Given an equation and a proposed solution, determine if it is correct by substitution. Include both correct and incorrect solutions.

10. **Number Pattern and Sequence Problems**: Given a sequence or pattern rule, set up and solve an equation to find a specific term or determine when a value occurs.

## Age-Based Complexity

Adjust cognitive demand and abstraction level based on student age:

### Younger Students (age < 13)
- Focus primarily on one-step and simple two-step equations
- Use smaller integer coefficients and constants
- Emphasize concrete balance and inverse operation thinking
- Provide more scaffolding with step-by-step templates
- Use familiar real-world contexts (pocket money, lunch costs, simple shopping)
- Avoid complex fractions; use halves and quarters if fractions are included
- Include visual representations of balance (scales, balanced diagrams described in text)

### Older Students (age >= 13)
- Include more complex two-step equations and variables on both sides
- Use larger coefficients and both positive and negative integers
- Introduce equations with fractions and decimals
- Require more complex word problem translation
- Include multi-step real-world scenarios
- Expect fluency with distributive property and simplification
- Challenge with non-routine problems requiring problem-solving strategies

## Difficulty Scaling

### Easy
- Predominantly one-step equations with positive integers
- Clear, direct word problems with obvious operations
- Simple variable on one side only
- Numbers small and familiar (under 30)
- Single-operation required to solve
- Verification examples with clear right/wrong answers
- Real-world contexts highly familiar and concrete

### Medium
- Mix of one-step and two-step equations
- Equations with variables on both sides (simple cases)
- Positive and negative integers
- Some simple fractions and decimals
- Word problems requiring careful reading and translation
- Multi-step reasoning within the context
- Numbers in reasonable ranges (up to 100)
- Some parentheses or distributive property needed

### Hard
- Complex two-step and multi-step equations
- Variables on both sides with more complex coefficients
- Equations with fractions and decimals throughout
- Parentheses and distributive property applications
- Complex word problems requiring interpretation and decision-making
- Non-routine problems with multiple solution pathways
- Equations that simplify to identities or contradictions (no solution/infinite solutions)
- Word problems with extraneous or constraint information

## Numerical Variation Principles

Vary numbers systematically to prevent repetition and build diverse problem-solving skills:

- **Coefficient Distribution**: Use varied coefficients (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 1/2, 1/4, 0.5, 0.25) that change which operation is performed
- **Constant Values**: Include both positive and negative constants, small and moderate magnitudes, creating different solution values
- **Solution Diversity**: Ensure solutions vary (positive, negative, zero, fractions, decimals) rather than clustering around common answers
- **Operation Sequencing**: Vary which operation appears first in two-step equations (addition then multiplication vs multiplication then addition)
- **Integer vs Non-Integer Solutions**: Include both whole number solutions and those requiring decimal or fraction answers
- **Problem Complexity**: Alternate between straightforward "solve the equation" and word problems with interpretation needed
- **Real-World Variety**: Change contexts across generations (shopping, age problems, distance/speed, geometry, business applications)

## Format and Representation Guidance

### When to Use Different Formats

- **Standard Equation Form**: For direct equation-solving tasks; present clearly with proper alignment and variables
- **Word Problems**: For real-world application and translation practice; vary sentence structures and complexity
- **Balance/Scale Diagrams**: Described textually to represent physical balance between sides of equation
- **Step-by-Step Templates**: For scaffolding, showing where variables and operations appear
- **Verification Format**: Show original equation and proposed solution clearly for checking work

### Presentation Patterns

- Use clear mathematical notation with proper equals signs and variable symbols
- When writing word problems, include all necessary information without extraneous details
- For multi-step problems, present information in logical order
- Show equations in standard form (like "a times x plus b equals c") or multi-variable form (like "a times x plus b equals c times x plus d") depending on complexity
- For word problems, clearly identify what is unknown and what information is given

## Strategy Emphasis

Encourage multiple valid approaches rather than prescribing single methods:

- **Balance Method**: Perform the same operation on both sides to maintain equality
- **Inverse Operations**: Use opposite operations to undo effects (add to undo subtract, divide to undo multiply)
- **Simplification First**: Collect like terms and simplify before solving complex equations
- **Substitution Checking**: Verify answers by substituting back into original equation
- **Working Backwards**: Start from the answer and work backwards to understand solution process
- **Mental Math**: For simple equations, calculate mentally rather than writing steps
- **Systematic Approach**: For complex equations, clearly identify steps and justify each transformation

Explicitly ask students to explain their strategy choice and verify their solutions to build metacognition.

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design tasks that help students confront and overcome typical errors:

- Forgetting to perform operations on both sides of the equation (breaking balance)
- Incorrectly changing the sign when moving terms (subtraction becoming addition)
- Multiplying or dividing only one term instead of the whole side
- Misapplying inverse operations (subtracting instead of adding)
- Not distributing correctly when parentheses are involved
- Incorrectly translating English phrases to algebraic expressions (e.g., "5 less than x" meaning "subtract 5 from x" vs "subtract x from 5")
- Confusing multiplication and addition in word problems
- Failing to check if the solution makes sense in the real-world context
- Writing equations with incorrect variable assignments

## Context Variety

While the backend variation system handles context diversity, align problems with developmentally appropriate scenarios:

- **Shopping and Money**: Calculating total costs, change, discounts, finding original prices
- **Age Problems**: Finding unknown ages given relationships (e.g., "parent is 3 times child's age")
- **Distance and Speed**: Calculating travel times, distances, or speeds given other information
- **Geometry Applications**: Finding dimensions of shapes given perimeter or area relationships
- **Sports and Measurement**: Scores, points, heights, weights, timing
- **Simple Business**: Profit/loss, cost per item, bulk pricing
- **Practical Household**: Sharing items fairly, recipe scaling, household budgets
- **Time and Duration**: Calculating durations, time remaining, scheduling problems
- **Temperature and Weather**: Temperature changes, freezing/boiling points

## Numerical Range Guidance

To support grade 7 students while maintaining accessibility:

- **Coefficients**: Typically 1-10, occasionally 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 0.5, 0.25
- **Constants**: Range from -50 to 100, with most in -20 to 50 range
- **Solutions**: Aim for variety including negative numbers, decimals, and simple fractions
- **Negative Numbers**: Regularly include negative integers in coefficients and constants
- **Fractions**: When included, use halves, thirds, quarters, fifths for accessibility
- **Decimals**: When included, limited to one or two decimal places

## Task Quality Guidelines

Every generated task should:

- Have exactly one correct solution unless specifically exploring "no solution" or "infinite solutions" cases
- Use realistic numbers that produce sensible results in word problem contexts
- Match the specified difficulty level consistently
- Include necessary context without excess information
- Use clear, grade-appropriate mathematical language
- For word problems, ensure the mathematical setup is unambiguous
- Have plausible distractors for multiple-choice (common errors like sign mistakes, forgot to perform on both sides)
- Require meaningful algebraic thinking rather than just arithmetic

## Language Considerations

The task generator will translate all tasks, but ensure the mathematical structure is language-neutral:

- Use internationally understood mathematical notation (variables like x, equals signs, standard operation symbols)
- Avoid idioms or culture-specific references that don't translate (adapt money/distance/measurement contexts)
- Keep sentence structures simple and clear for translation
- Use common vocabulary rather than regional terms
- Focus on mathematical concepts that have clear equivalents across languages
- When translating word problems, preserve the mathematical relationships clearly
