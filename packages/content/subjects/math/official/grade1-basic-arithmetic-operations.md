# Basic Arithmetic Operations (0-20)

Generate tasks that help students master addition and subtraction within 20, with emphasis on mental calculation strategies, number bonds, and crossing the ten boundary.

## Problem Structure Variations

Create diverse task types that test understanding from different angles:

1. **Direct calculation tasks**: Present addition or subtraction problems requiring students to find the result
2. **Reverse calculation (finding unknowns)**: Provide equation with missing addend, minuend, or subtrahend (e.g., "? + 7 = 15" or "12 - ? = 5")
3. **Comparison tasks**: Compare two calculations or determine which operation yields larger/smaller results
4. **Strategy application**: Ask students to identify which mental strategy would be most efficient for specific problems
5. **Number bond decomposition**: Break numbers into parts (e.g., "Show different ways to make 14 using addition")
6. **Word problems from real contexts**: Present scenarios involving combining groups, taking away, finding differences, or equalizing quantities
7. **Equation verification**: Determine whether given equations are correct or find errors
8. **Pattern completion**: Provide number sequences or calculation chains with missing elements
9. **Multi-step problems**: Combine two operations in simple everyday scenarios
10. **Visual representation interpretation**: Present diagrams (number lines, ten-frames, bar models) and ask students to write matching equations

## Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

Adjust presentation and cognitive demands based on `{{age}}`:

**Ages 6-7 (beginning of grade 1):**
- Focus on qualitative understanding ("more," "less," "same")
- Use visual supports extensively (describe positioning on number line, arrangement in ten-frames, grouping representations)
- Present problems with smaller numbers (primarily 0-10 initially, progressing to 20)
- Use concrete, familiar contexts (toys, animals, fruits, family members)
- Single-step problems with clear action words

**Ages 7+ (progressing through grade 1):**
- Increase quantitative precision and symbolic representation
- Reduce visual scaffolding, emphasize mental strategies
- Include problems requiring crossing the ten boundary
- Present more abstract contexts or multiple solution paths
- Introduce multi-step reasoning

## Difficulty Level Differentiation

Scale complexity according to `{{difficulty}}`:

**Easy:**
- Addition and subtraction within 10 without crossing boundaries
- Direct calculation with clear operation indicated
- Word problems with explicit action and single operation
- Visual representations clearly showing quantities
- Problems designed to use doubles, near-doubles, or adding/subtracting 1 or 2

**Medium:**
- Addition and subtraction within 20 including crossing ten
- Missing number problems requiring reverse thinking
- Word problems requiring students to determine appropriate operation
- Compare multiple calculations or strategies
- Problems encouraging decomposition strategies (making 10, splitting numbers)

**Hard:**
- Complex number bond problems with multiple solutions
- Multi-step word problems combining addition and subtraction
- Strategy analysis and optimization tasks
- Problems with extraneous information requiring selection
- Equations with unknowns in different positions

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Generate diverse numerical combinations following these principles:

- **Range distribution**: Use numbers across the full 0-20 range, not clustering around few values
- **Boundary crossing**: Mix problems that stay within 0-10, cross from teens to single digits, and remain in teens
- **Strategy diversity**: Create problems naturally suited to different strategies (doubles 6+6, near-doubles 6+7, making ten 8+7, counting on 14+3)
- **Result variety**: Vary whether sums/differences are even, odd, multiples of 5, or other values
- **Randomization**: Avoid predictable patterns or favorite numbers appearing repeatedly
- **Operation balance**: Include addition and subtraction in roughly equal proportions
- **Position variation**: In missing number problems, vary whether unknown is at start, middle, or end of equation

## Calculation Strategy Emphasis

Highlight different mental calculation approaches across tasks:

- **Making 10**: Decompose one addend to reach 10, then add remainder (for crossing ten in addition)
- **Doubles and near-doubles**: Use known doubles (5+5, 7+7) to solve near-doubles (5+6, 7+8)
- **Counting on/back**: Add or subtract small numbers by counting forward or backward
- **Using number bonds to 10**: Apply knowledge of pairs summing to 10 (4+6, 3+7, etc.)
- **Decomposition**: Break numbers into tens and ones for easier calculation
- **Inverse operations**: Use subtraction to check addition and vice versa
- **Related facts**: Connect related calculations (if 8+5=13, then 5+8=13 and 13-5=8)

## Context and Representation Format

**Word Problem Contexts** (vary across tasks):
Describe everyday scenarios such as: collecting items, sharing among people, measuring quantities, playing games with scores, shopping with coins, arranging objects in groups, comparing collections, completing sets, or tracking changes over time. Focus on situations familiar to young children.

**Visual Representations** (when appropriate):
Describe what diagrams should show without providing actual code. For example: number lines with marked positions and jumps, ten-frame arrangements showing filled and empty spaces, bar model diagrams comparing quantities, or grouping illustrations. Specify positioning and relationships, not implementation.

**Mathematical Notation:**
Use child-friendly equation formats. Represent missing numbers with symbols (boxes, question marks, or blanks). Present operations clearly with standard symbols. When describing LaTeX usage: inline for simple equations within sentences, display format for featured problems.

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design tasks that help identify and correct typical errors:

- Confusion between addition and subtraction operations
- Difficulty crossing the ten boundary (e.g., computing 8+5 as 12 instead of 13)
- Not recognizing commutativity of addition (5+8 vs 8+5)
- Counting errors when using counting-on strategy
- Misunderstanding subtraction as always "making smaller" rather than finding differences
- Incorrectly applying number bonds from 10 to other contexts

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do NOT create tasks that:
- Use the same number combinations repeatedly (e.g., always 7+8 for near-doubles)
- Present word problems with identical structure differing only in numbers
- Rely exclusively on one calculation strategy
- Feature predictable number patterns students can exploit without calculating
- Include only symbolic calculations without connecting to meaning
- Present numbers always in same order (e.g., always smaller + larger)
- Use culturally specific references unfamiliar to international students
