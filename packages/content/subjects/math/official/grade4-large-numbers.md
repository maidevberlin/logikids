id: grade4-large-numbers
name: Large Numbers
description: Understanding numbers up to one million, place value, rounding, and number comparison
grade: 4
ages:
  - 9
  - 10
focus: Number sense and place value in large numbers
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Read, write, and represent numbers up to 1,000,000
  - Understand and apply place value concepts in large numbers
  - Round numbers to various place values (tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands)
  - Compare and order large numbers using place value understanding
  - Recognize and use number relationships in large numbers
prerequisites:
  - grade3-number-range-up-to-1000
real_world_context: Large numbers appear in population statistics, distances between cities, national budgets, large quantities in industry, sports attendance figures, and geographic measurements
problem_types:
  - Place Value
  - Number Representation
  - Number Comparison
  - Rounding
  - Number Line
  - Missing Digits
  - Number Building
  - Place Value Operations
  - Real-World Contexts
  - Error Analysis
age_guidelines:
  9:
    - Focus on numbers up to 100,000 initially before extending to one million
    - Provide more structured support with place value charts or number lines shown
    - Use word problems with familiar contexts (school population, distances to nearby cities)
    - Break multi-step problems into separate questions
    - Emphasize concrete representations and visual models
    - Focus on rounding to nearest ten, hundred, or thousand
  10:
    - Work confidently with the full range to 1,000,000
    - Present problems requiring multi-step reasoning without explicit scaffolding
    - Include more abstract mathematical contexts alongside real-world applications
    - Expect understanding of all place value positions simultaneously
    - Include rounding to any place value including ten thousands and hundred thousands
    - Present more complex number comparisons with multiple numbers
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct place value identification in clear numbers
    - Simple number comparisons with obvious differences
    - Rounding to familiar place values (tens, hundreds, thousands) with numbers that round clearly
    - Converting between two representations (e.g., standard to word form only)
    - Single-step problems with one concept at a time
  medium:
    - Place value problems requiring understanding of multiple positions
    - Number comparisons with closer values requiring careful analysis
    - Rounding to any place value with numbers near rounding boundaries
    - Converting between all three representations or identifying patterns
    - Two-step problems combining concepts (e.g., round then compare)
    - Error identification in moderately complex situations
  hard:
    - Complex place value reasoning with missing information or constraints
    - Comparison and ordering of many numbers with very close values
    - Rounding challenges with multiple steps or reverse reasoning ("what numbers round to X?")
    - Number building with multiple criteria to satisfy simultaneously
    - Multi-step problems integrating several concepts (place value, comparison, rounding, operations)
    - Error analysis requiring deep place value understanding
    - Abstract reasoning about number relationships and patterns

version_notes: Migrated from prose format to structured frontmatter-based format. Extracted problem types, age-specific guidelines, and difficulty scaling into structured fields.
