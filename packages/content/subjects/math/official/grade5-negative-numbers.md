id: grade5-negative-numbers
name: Negative Numbers
description: Introduction to integers, number line representation, comparing and ordering integers, and real-world contexts
grade: 5
focus: Number sense and integer concepts
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand negative numbers as extensions of the natural number system
  - Represent integers on a number line with appropriate positioning
  - Compare and order positive and negative integers
  - Identify and use opposite numbers (additive inverses)
  - Interpret negative numbers in real-world contexts like temperature and elevation
  - Calculate distance between integers on a number line
problem_types:
  - Number line placement
  - Integer comparison
  - Ordering sequences
  - Opposite numbers
  - Temperature problems
  - Elevation problems
  - Context interpretation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Use integers from -20 to +20
    - Simple comparisons between two integers
    - Clear visual number line support
  medium:
    - Use integers from -100 to +100
    - Order sequences of 4-5 integers
    - Mixed positive and negative comparisons
  hard:
    - Use larger integers beyond ±100
    - Complex ordering with multiple integers
    - Calculate distances between integers on number line
real_world_context:
  - Temperature readings in weather forecasts, showing temperatures below and above zero
  - Elevation levels showing heights above and below sea level in geography
  - Bank account balances representing deposits (positive) and debts (negative)
  - Building floors with basement levels shown as negative numbers
prerequisites:
  - grade4-numbers-to-million
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid addition or subtraction operations with negative numbers
  - Don't include multiplication or division of integers
  - Avoid abstract contexts without real-world grounding
  - Don't use decimal notation with negative signs
  - Avoid mixing negative numbers with fractions
