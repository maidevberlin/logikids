id: grade8-fractional-terms
name: Fractional Terms
description: Operations on algebraic fractions - simplifying, expanding, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractional terms
grade: 8
focus: Algebraic manipulation of rational expressions
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and analyze the structure of fractional terms with variables
  - Expand and simplify fractional terms by factoring and canceling
  - Find common denominators for fractional terms with different denominators
  - Add and subtract fractional terms by using common denominators
  - Multiply and divide fractional terms using fraction rules
  - Simplify complex fractional expressions with multiple operations
  - Determine restrictions on variables to avoid division by zero
problem_types:
  - Simplification
  - Expansion
  - Addition with LCD
  - Subtraction with LCD
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Mixed operations
  - Domain restrictions
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-variable terms with simple linear expressions
    - Denominators are simple monomials or binomials
    - Maximum one operation per problem
  medium:
    - Terms with factoring required (distributive property)
    - Denominators requiring LCD calculation
    - Two consecutive operations
  hard:
    - Complex expressions requiring multiple factoring steps
    - Three or more consecutive operations
    - Nested fractions or rational expressions with quadratic factors
real_world_context:
  - Physics formulas like speed calculations (distance/time) with variable quantities
  - Electrical resistance formulas combining resistors in circuits (1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2)
  - Chemical concentration calculations when mixing solutions with different dilutions
  - Engineering calculations involving ratios of changing quantities
prerequisites:
  - grade7-algebraic-terms
  - grade6-fractions-basics
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid fractional terms with polynomials of degree higher than 2
  - Don't use more than two variables in a single expression
  - Avoid nested fractions with more than two levels
  - Don't combine fractional terms with radical expressions
  - Avoid contexts unfamiliar to 13-14 year olds
