difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-variable terms with simple linear expressions
    - Denominators are simple monomials or binomials
    - Maximum one operation per problem
  medium:
    - Terms with factoring required (distributive property)
    - Denominators requiring LCD calculation
    - Two consecutive operations
  hard:
    - Complex expressions requiring multiple factoring steps
    - Three or more consecutive operations
    - Nested fractions or rational expressions with quadratic factors
real_world_context:

  - Gear train calculations for bicycle drivetrains with multiple sprocket sizes
  - Population density formulas dividing population by area in geography
prerequisites:
  - grade7-algebraic-terms
  - grade6-fractions-basics
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid fractional terms with polynomials of degree higher than 2
  - Don't use more than two variables in a single expression
  - Avoid nested fractions with more than two levels
  - Don't combine fractional terms with radical expressions
  - Avoid contexts unfamiliar to 13-14 year olds
