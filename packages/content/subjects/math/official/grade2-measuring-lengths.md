# Measuring Lengths

Generate a task where {{name}} measures, estimates, or converts lengths using standard units appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Focus on millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), and meters (m).

Use varied approaches:

**Unit Conversions:**
- Convert between centimeters and millimeters
- Example: "A crayon is $8$ cm long. How many millimeters is that?" (Answer: $80$ mm, since $1$ cm $= 10$ mm)
- Convert between meters and centimeters
- Example: "A table is $2$ meters long. How many centimeters is that?" (Answer: $200$ cm, since $1$ m $= 100$ cm)

**Mixed Units:**
- Work with lengths expressed in multiple units
- Example: "A ribbon is $1$ meter and $45$ centimeters long. How many centimeters is that in total?"
- Example: "Convert $3$ m $25$ cm into centimeters only."

**Measuring with Rulers:**
- Read measurements from a ruler description
- Example: "On a ruler, a line starts at $3$ cm and ends at $17$ cm. How long is the line?"
- Use starting points other than zero to practice subtraction

**Estimation:**
- Estimate lengths of familiar objects
- Example: "Which is a better estimate for the length of your hand: $15$ mm, $15$ cm, or $15$ m?"
- Compare estimates: "Is a door taller than $2$ meters or shorter?"

**Comparing Lengths:**
- Compare objects measured in different units
- Example: "A book is $25$ cm long and a pen is $180$ mm long. Which is longer?"
- Require conversion to compare: $25$ cm $= 250$ mm

**Addition and Subtraction:**
- Add or subtract lengths, possibly requiring unit conversion
- Example: "Maria has two ribbons. One is $45$ cm and the other is $38$ cm. How long are they together?"
- Example: "A stick was $1$ m $20$ cm long. Tom cut off $35$ cm. How long is it now?"

**Real-World Contexts:**
- Measure classroom objects, body parts, or everyday items
- Example: "The height of a door is about $2$ meters and $10$ centimeters. Express this height only in centimeters."
- Examples: pencils, books, tables, arms, classroom length

**Choosing Appropriate Units:**
- Determine which unit is most appropriate for measuring different objects
- Example: "Would you measure the thickness of a coin in millimeters, centimeters, or meters?"
- Thickness of book: mm; length of desk: cm; length of hallway: m

**Reading Scales:**
- Interpret measuring tools with markings
- Example: "A measuring tape shows $1$ m $65$ cm. How many centimeters is this?"

Use tables when comparing multiple measurements:

| Object | Length |
|--------|--------|
| Pencil | $18$ cm |
| Eraser | $45$ mm |
| Ruler | $30$ cm |

Include LaTeX for all measurements: $5$ cm, $120$ mm, $1.5$ m. Use realistic measurements appropriate for objects 7-8 year olds encounter daily.
