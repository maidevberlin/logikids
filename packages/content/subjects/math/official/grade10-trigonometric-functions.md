name: Trigonometric Functions
description: Understanding sine and cosine as periodic functions, analyzing parameter effects in transformations a·sin(b·(x+c))+d, and modeling periodic real-world phenomena
grade: 10
focus: Periodic functions and trigonometric transformations
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Derive sine and cosine graphs from unit circle and justify periodicity
  - Describe how parameters a, b, c, and d affect the graph of f(x) = a·sin(b·(x+c))+d
  - Identify amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift from function equations
  - Sketch graphs of transformed sine and cosine functions using transformation parameters
  - Write function equations from given periodic graphs
  - Model periodic real-world phenomena such as tides, sound waves, and seasonal patterns
  - Explain the relationship between angular frequency and period length
problem_types:
  - Parameter identification
  - Graph sketching
  - Equation from graph
  - Period calculation
  - Amplitude determination
  - Phase shift analysis
  - Periodic modeling
  - Transformation comparison
  - Frequency interpretation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify amplitude and period from equations with single parameter changes
    - Sketch basic sine or cosine graphs with amplitude or period transformations only
    - Calculate period from angular frequency for simple integer values
  medium:
    - Identify all four parameters from equations with multiple transformations
    - Sketch graphs with combined transformations (amplitude, period, shifts)
    - Match periodic graphs to equations by analyzing transformation features
  hard:
    - Write complete equations from complex periodic graphs with all transformations
    - Model real-world periodic phenomena with specific amplitude, period, and shift constraints
    - Analyze and compare multiple transformed functions on the same coordinate system
prerequisites:
  - grade9-right-triangle-trigonometry
real_world_context:
  - Ocean tides follow periodic patterns that can be modeled with sine functions to predict high and low tide times for navigation and coastal activities
  - Sound waves and musical notes are periodic vibrations with frequencies and amplitudes that determine pitch and volume in acoustics
  - Seasonal temperature variations throughout the year follow sinusoidal patterns with annual periods used in climate modeling
  - Day length varies periodically through the year with a 12-month period, modeled for agricultural planning and solar energy calculations
  - Alternating current in electrical systems oscillates sinusoidally with specific frequency and amplitude for power distribution
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using radian measure without prior introduction or clear notation
  - Do not use angles beyond one or two periods (0 to 4π) for basic tasks
  - Avoid problems where phase shift and vertical shift are both zero
  - Do not include tangent function (concept focuses on sine and cosine)
  - Avoid frequency values that produce periods longer than 4π
