# Time Spans Tasks

Create tasks that help students read clocks at full and half hours, calculate simple time durations, and understand calendar concepts like days, weeks, and months. Focus on practical time-related problems from daily life.

**Vary the clock reading skills:**
- **Vary using full hours:** Show clocks at 8:00, 11:00, 2:00, etc. Use SVG clock faces with $8:00$ format
- **Vary using half hours:** Show clocks at 7:30, 2:30, 10:30, etc. Explain "half past seven" = $7:30$
- **Vary using time comparisons:** "Which is later: 9:00 or 11:00?" or "Which is earlier: 3:30 or 3:00?"
- **Vary using time ordering:** Put times in sequence: $1:00, 4:30, 7:00, 9:30$
- **Vary using analog/digital matching:** Match analog clock faces to digital times

**Vary the time span calculations:**
- **Vary using simple durations:** "School starts at 8:00 and ends at 1:00. How many hours is that?" Use $1:00 - 8:00 = 5$ hours
- **Vary using half-hour spans:** "The movie starts at 2:00 and ends at 3:30. How long is it?" Use $3:30 - 2:00 = 1.5$ hours
- **Vary using forward counting:** "It's 9:00 now. What time is it in 2 hours?" Use $9:00 + 2 = 11:00$
- **Vary using backward counting:** "It's 5:00 now. What time was it 3 hours ago?" Use $5:00 - 3 = 2:00$

**Vary the calendar concepts:**
- **Vary using days:** "If Monday is the 5th, what date is Wednesday?" or "How many days from Tuesday to Friday?"
- **Vary using weeks:** "A week has 7 days. How many days in 2 weeks?" Use $7 \times 2 = 14$ days
- **Vary using months:** "Name the 12 months in order" or "Which month comes after March?"
- **Vary using month lengths:** "February has 28 days. March has 31 days. How many days total?" Use $28 + 31 = 59$ days

**Vary the context:**
- School schedule: "Reading is from 9:00 to 10:30. How long is that?"
- TV programs: "Your show starts at 6:30 and lasts 1 hour. When does it end?"
- Appointments: "Your dentist appointment is at 3:00. It's 1:30 now. How long until your appointment?"
- Daily activities: "Breakfast is at 7:30. Lunch is at 12:30. How many hours between them?"
- Birthday planning: "Your birthday is in 2 weeks. How many days is that?"
- Vacation counting: "Summer vacation is 6 weeks long. How many days is that?"

**Vary the representation:**
- Use SVG clock faces showing both hour and minute hands clearly
- Create tables showing weekly schedules or TV program times
- Use number lines to show time progression
- Show calendar grids for days/weeks/months

**Use clear SVG clock diagrams. Use LaTeX for time calculations: $9:00 + 2 = 11:00$. Include tables for schedules. Keep language age-appropriate and tied to familiar routines.**
