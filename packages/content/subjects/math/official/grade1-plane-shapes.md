id: grade1-plane-shapes
name: Plane Shapes
description: Identifying, naming, and describing basic 2D shapes
grade: 1
focus: Geometry and spatial reasoning
difficulty: easy

learning_objectives:
  - Identify and name circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles
  - Describe basic properties of shapes (number of sides, corners, curved or straight)
  - Compare shapes by their attributes (same shape, different size; same sides, different shape)
  - Recognize shapes in different orientations and sizes
  - Find shapes in the environment and real objects
  - Sort and classify shapes based on their properties

problem_types:
  - Shape identification
  - Property description
  - Shape comparison
  - Attribute sorting
  - Real-world recognition
  - Shape matching
  - Corner counting
  - Side counting

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Use standard orientations (square not tilted, triangle point-up)
    - Focus on one attribute at a time (sides OR corners, not both)
    - Clear visual differences between shapes
  medium:
    - Mix orientations (tilted squares, rotated triangles)
    - Compare two attributes simultaneously (sides AND corners)
    - Include shapes of different sizes
  hard:
    - Non-standard orientations and sizes combined
    - Classify multiple shapes using complex criteria
    - Identify shapes within composite figures

prerequisites: []

real_world_context:
  - Traffic signs use different shapes (circles for prohibitions, triangles for warnings, rectangles for information)
  - Everyday objects have recognizable shapes (clocks are circles, windows are rectangles, roofs are triangles)
  - Pizza slices are triangles, cookies can be circles or rectangles
  - Building blocks and toys come in different shapes
  - Picture frames are usually rectangles or squares
  - A wizard sorting magical gems by their shapes in an enchanted tower
  - Sports fields and courts have different shapes (rectangular soccer field, circular center spot)
  - Musical instruments have shape parts (circular drums, triangular triangle instrument)
  - An architect designing a house with different shaped windows and doors
  - Sandwiches cut into triangles, squares, or rectangles for a picnic
  - A robot identifying shapes to navigate through a maze
  - Art projects using cut-out shapes to create pictures and patterns

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid shapes with more than 4 sides (not appropriate for grade 1)
  - Don't use technical terms like "polygon" or "vertex"
  - Avoid overlapping shapes that create visual confusion
  - Don't ask about angle measurements or precise dimensions
  - Avoid shapes too similar in size and color (reduces clarity)

version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 5 to 12 items for better variety
