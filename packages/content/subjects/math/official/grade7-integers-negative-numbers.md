description: Extending the number system to include negative integers, understanding absolute value, and performing operations with positive and negative numbers
grade: 7
ages:
  - 12
  - 13
focus: Extending the number system to include negatives, operations with integers, real-world applications
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Represent integers on a number line and in coordinate systems
  - Compare and order integers using inequality symbols
  - Understand and apply absolute value in context
  - Add and subtract integers using multiple strategies (number line, counters, algorithms)
  - Multiply and divide integers with proper sign rules
  - Solve real-world problems involving positive and negative numbers
  - Understand the inverse relationship between addition/subtraction with integers
prerequisites:
  - grade4-large-numbers
  - grade4-written-addition-and-division
real_world_context: Temperature changes (hot/cold), elevation and depth (above/below sea level), financial transactions (deposits/withdrawals, profit/loss, debt), time (before/after), sports scoring (gains/losses), direction and movement
problem_types:
  - Number line positioning
  - Comparison and ordering
  - Absolute value
  - Integer addition
  - Integer subtraction
  - Integer multiplication
  - Integer division
  - Multi-step operations
  - Real-world contexts
  - Sign rule justification
age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Use concrete visual representations (number lines, counters/chips with two colors for positive/negative)
    - Start with addition and subtraction before introducing multiplication and division
    - Focus on small integers (roughly -10 to +10) initially
    - Emphasize the number line as the primary strategy for addition/subtraction
    - Use abundant real-world contexts to make abstract concepts concrete
    - Include visual scaffolding showing the meaning of operations
    - Begin with one operation per task before combining operations
  13:
    - Progress to more abstract symbolic representations
    - Include all four operations in varied contexts
    - Use larger integers and more complex combinations
    - Introduce formal sign rules and algorithmic approaches
    - Require written justification of sign rules using mathematical reasoning
    - Include multi-step problems and problems requiring planning
    - Connect operations with geometric representations (coordinate plane, vectors)
    - Introduce notation like -(−5) = 5 and explain why this is true
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Work with small integers (roughly -10 to +10)
    - Single operations only (either addition or subtraction, not mixed)
    - Visual number line provided or implied
    - Clear, straightforward real-world contexts
    - Mostly addition situations; subtraction limited to simple cases
    - Focus on understanding representation and basic comparison
    - Simple absolute value calculations
    - No multi-step problems
  medium:
    - Work with integers from approximately -20 to +20
    - Mix addition and subtraction in context problems
    - Introduction to multiplication and division with integers
    - More abstract contexts that still connect to real experience
    - Two-step problems combining related operations
    - Require proper use of sign rules for multiplication/division
    - Include some problems requiring rewriting subtraction as addition
    - Apply absolute value in more complex scenarios
    - Coordinate plane work with negative coordinates
  hard:
    - Larger integer values (−100 to +100 or beyond)
    - All four operations in varied combination
    - Abstract contexts with less concrete scaffolding
    - Three or more step problems requiring planning and strategic thinking
    - Problems requiring deep understanding of operation meanings
    - Justification of sign rules using mathematical reasoning
    - Complex real-world scenarios with multiple stages
    - Order of operations with integer expressions
    - Work with integers in coordinate geometry
    - Problems requiring estimation or reasonableness checking with integers
