# Integers and Negative Numbers

Generate tasks that help students master the concept of integers and develop computational fluency with negative numbers. This is a critical transition from natural numbers to the entire number system. Tasks should emphasize the relational nature of positive and negative numbers, the meaning of operations in context, and proper application of sign rules.

## Problem Type Variations

Create diverse task structures:

1. **Number Line Positioning**: Place integers on a number line, identify missing integers, or mark specific positions given relative descriptions
2. **Comparison and Ordering**: Order a set of integers from least to greatest (or greatest to least), use inequality symbols to compare pairs of integers
3. **Absolute Value Tasks**: Find the absolute value of given integers, solve problems involving distance from zero, compare absolute values
4. **Integer Addition**: Solve addition problems using various representations (number line, counters, algorithm), including combinations of positive and negative addends
5. **Integer Subtraction**: Solve subtraction problems, reinforce that subtraction can be rewritten as addition of the opposite
6. **Integer Multiplication**: Apply sign rules (positive × positive = positive, negative × negative = positive, positive × negative = negative), multiply integers with different signs
7. **Integer Division**: Apply sign rules to division problems, interpret remainders in context, divide integers with different signs
8. **Multi-Step Operations**: Combine addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in appropriate sequences with correct order of operations
9. **Real-World Context Problems**: Temperature changes, elevation/depth differences, financial scenarios (profit/loss, debt), time intervals
10. **Sign Rule Justification**: Explain why the sign rules for multiplication and division work (using repeated addition or area models)
11. **Opposite Number Concepts**: Identify additive inverses, find numbers that sum to zero, understand pairs of opposites
12. **Integer Sequences**: Identify patterns in integer sequences (arithmetic progressions with negative common differences), predict next terms
13. **Coordinate Plane**: Identify and plot points with negative coordinates, find distances between points with negative values
14. **Error Analysis**: Identify and correct errors in integer operations, such as sign mistakes or operation misunderstandings

## Age-Based Scaffolding

Adapt complexity based on student age and development:

**For younger students ({{age}} < 13):**
- Use concrete visual representations (number lines, counters/chips with two colors for positive/negative)
- Start with addition and subtraction before introducing multiplication and division
- Focus on small integers (roughly -10 to +10) initially
- Emphasize the number line as the primary strategy for addition/subtraction
- Use abundant real-world contexts to make abstract concepts concrete
- Include visual scaffolding showing the meaning of operations
- Begin with one operation per task before combining operations

**For older students ({{age}} >= 13):**
- Progress to more abstract symbolic representations
- Include all four operations in varied contexts
- Use larger integers and more complex combinations
- Introduce formal sign rules and algorithmic approaches
- Require written justification of sign rules using mathematical reasoning
- Include multi-step problems and problems requiring planning
- Connect operations with geometric representations (coordinate plane, vectors)
- Introduce notation like -(−5) = 5 and explain why this is true

## Difficulty Scaling

Adjust problem complexity based on difficulty level:

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = 'easy'):**
- Work with small integers (roughly -10 to +10)
- Single operations only (either addition or subtraction, not mixed)
- Visual number line provided or implied
- Clear, straightforward real-world contexts
- Mostly addition situations; subtraction limited to simple cases
- Focus on understanding representation and basic comparison
- Simple absolute value calculations
- No multi-step problems

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = 'medium'):**
- Work with integers from approximately -20 to +20
- Mix addition and subtraction in context problems
- Introduction to multiplication and division with integers
- More abstract contexts that still connect to real experience
- Two-step problems combining related operations
- Require proper use of sign rules for multiplication/division
- Include some problems requiring rewriting subtraction as addition
- Apply absolute value in more complex scenarios
- Coordinate plane work with negative coordinates

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = 'hard'):**
- Larger integer values (−100 to +100 or beyond)
- All four operations in varied combination
- Abstract contexts with less concrete scaffolding
- Three or more step problems requiring planning and strategic thinking
- Problems requiring deep understanding of operation meanings
- Justification of sign rules using mathematical reasoning
- Complex real-world scenarios with multiple stages
- Order of operations with integer expressions
- Work with integers in coordinate geometry
- Problems requiring estimation or reasonableness checking with integers

## Numerical Value Variation Principles

Generate diverse numbers and combinations following these principles:

- **Sign variety**: Mix positive and negative numbers in natural, unsorted ways
- **Magnitude progression**: When using sequences, ensure varied step sizes (not just steps of 1)
- **Operation symmetry**: Include problems where the same operation appears with different sign combinations (5 + 3, 5 + (−3), (−5) + 3, (−5) + (−3))
- **Zero inclusion**: Include problems with zero as an addend, intermediate value, or result
- **Opposite pairs**: Include numbers that are opposites to reinforce additive inverse concept
- **Realistic scales**: When using temperature, use age-appropriate ranges (−20°C to +40°C); for money, use realistic amounts; for elevation, use meaningful differences
- **Context variety**: Alternate between financial, temperature, elevation, time, and directional contexts
- **Problem structure variation**: Avoid repetitive problem structures; mix finding the answer, finding a missing value, and explaining relationships

## Answer Format and Verification

**For comparison/ordering tasks:**
- Use clear inequality symbols (< , > , = , ≤ , ≥)
- List integers in proper order with clear separation
- For coordinate plane work, write ordered pairs with parentheses (x, y)

**For calculation tasks:**
- Show reasoning or work, not just the final answer
- For addition/subtraction, accept number line representations, written steps, or verbal explanations
- For multiplication/division, require proper application of sign rules
- Include a labeled final answer with units if applicable

**For real-world problems:**
- Clearly identify what the integer represents (e.g., "−8 means 8 meters below sea level")
- Show the calculation with proper notation
- Write the answer in context-appropriate language and units
- Verify reasonableness given the problem situation

**Verification strategies to include:**
- Use the inverse operation to check addition/subtraction (add to check subtraction, subtract to check addition)
- Check that the answer's sign makes sense in context
- Verify order of operations is applied correctly for multi-step problems
- Compare to a reasonable estimate when possible

## Common Misconceptions to Address

Design some tasks to specifically challenge these typical errors:

- Confusing the sign of a number with the operation (e.g., treating "−5" and "subtract 5" as always the same)
- Incorrectly applying sign rules in multiplication (e.g., thinking negative × negative = negative)
- Adding or subtracting the absolute values without considering the signs
- Misunderstanding subtraction of negative numbers (thinking "5 − (−3)" should give 2 instead of 8)
- Placing negative numbers incorrectly on a number line (not understanding relative position)
- Forgetting to include the negative sign in the answer or incorrectly determining its sign
- Thinking that division of integers always results in a whole number
- Not using absolute value correctly or confusing it with the number itself
- Assuming operations work the same way with negative numbers as with positive (without understanding why they differ)
- Incorrectly handling zero in calculations (forgetting that −0 = 0)

## Contextual Diversity

Use varied real-world contexts appropriate for middle school students:

- **Temperature**: Weather changes, comparing temperatures in different locations, freezing points, heat waves, wind chill
- **Elevation**: Mountains and valleys, sea level reference, underwater depths, building floors, altitude changes
- **Finance**: Bank accounts (deposits positive, withdrawals negative), profit and loss, debt, buying and selling, stock prices
- **Time**: Years before/after a reference point (BCE/CE), time zones, time differences, age calculations across centuries
- **Sports**: Score changes (gains and losses), team rankings, point differences, altitude effects on performance
- **Direction**: North/South movements, East/West positions, up/down directions, displacement
- **Measurements**: Changes in quantity, differences from a reference standard, calibration (thermometer, scale)

Ensure contexts are:
- Age-appropriate and relevant to student interests
- Realistic in terms of numbers used
- Free of bias and culturally neutral where possible
- Meaningful for understanding the practical importance of negative numbers

## Visual Representation

**When to use visual supports:**
- Number line: For integer representation, comparison, addition/subtraction strategies, finding opposites, absolute value distance
- Two-color counters: For modeling addition/subtraction concretely (show/remove pairs to find sums)
- Coordinate plane: For plotting points with negative coordinates, showing transformations, introducing vectors
- Thermometer diagrams: For temperature contexts, showing distance from zero
- Number table: For showing sign rules in multiplication (e.g., table showing all sign combinations)
- Timeline: For time-based contexts, showing before/after reference points

**Avoid:**
- Do not show worked examples with specific numbers
- Do not include templates that students could simply copy
- Do not use overly decorative visuals that distract from mathematics
- Describe visual formats and strategies rather than providing copy-able diagrams

## Key Instructional Emphasis

Tasks should reinforce these fundamental understandings:

- Integers extend the number system to include zero and negative numbers, not just natural numbers
- Every integer except zero has an opposite; these are additive inverses
- Absolute value represents distance from zero on the number line; it's always non-negative
- Addition of integers can be understood through movement on a number line or combining/removing counter pairs
- Subtraction of integers is equivalent to adding the opposite (a − b = a + (−b))
- Multiplication and division sign rules follow logically from understanding the operation and integer relationships
- Negative numbers have real-world meanings; context helps make them concrete
- The number line is a powerful tool for visualizing relationships and operations with integers
- Order of operations applies with integers just as with whole numbers

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Do not create tasks that:
- Use contexts so abstract that the negative number meaning is unclear
- Provide complete worked examples that could be copied rather than understood
- Skip the visual/concrete stage and move immediately to abstract operations
- Use unrelated or confusing contexts that don't genuinely require negative numbers
- Focus on speed without understanding of sign rules and operation meanings
- Mix too many new concepts in a single task (e.g., introducing multiplication signs with a complex real-world scenario)
- Include unrealistic numbers or contexts that don't match student experience
- Neglect to have students explain their reasoning and connections to context
- Treat negative numbers as just "weird" or "tricky" without helping students develop genuine understanding
- Use exclusively horizontal (symbolic) representations without supporting with number lines or other visuals
