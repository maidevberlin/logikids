name: Linear Equation Systems
description: Solving systems of two linear equations with two unknowns using graphical methods and substitution, understanding solution cases (unique, none, infinite)
grade: 8
focus: Systems of linear equations and algebraic solution methods
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Model real-world situations as systems of two linear equations with two unknowns
  - Solve linear systems graphically by finding the intersection point of two lines
  - Apply the substitution method to solve linear systems algebraically
  - Verify solutions by substituting into both original equations
  - Determine whether a system has a unique solution, no solution, or infinitely many solutions
  - Interpret solutions of linear systems in the context of the original problem
  - Compare efficiency of graphical versus algebraic solution methods
problem_types:
  - Graphical solution
  - Substitution method
  - Word problem modeling
  - Solution verification
  - Parallel lines (no solution)
  - Identical lines (infinite solutions)
  - Unique solution case
  - Method comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Systems with one equation already solved for a variable (y = ... form)
    - Integer coefficients between -5 and 5
    - Solutions are integers between -10 and 10
  medium:
    - Both equations in standard form requiring algebraic manipulation
    - Coefficients between -10 and 10, may include fractions like 1/2 or 2/3
    - Solutions may be simple fractions or decimals
  hard:
    - Systems requiring multiple substitution steps or complex simplification
    - Word problems requiring translation of two constraints into equations
    - Special cases - parallel lines (no solution) or identical lines (infinite solutions)
prerequisites:
  - grade7-linear-equations
  - grade7-proportionality
  - grade6-coordinate-system
real_world_context:
  - Determining the mixture of two ingredients needed to achieve specific nutritional targets for protein and calories
  - Finding the break-even point where two different pricing plans (subscription vs pay-per-use) cost the same amount
  - Calculating when two moving objects (cars, trains) traveling at different speeds will meet at the same location
  - Solving age problems where relationships between two people's ages are given at different time points
  - Balancing budget constraints when shopping with two different discount offers or payment methods
  - Athletes combining two training types to meet both time and calorie-burning goals
  - Chemists mixing solutions of different concentrations to achieve a target mixture
  - Party planners calculating combinations of food trays to meet both guest count and budget
  - Farmers allocating land between two crops to maximize profit within labor constraints
  - Musicians scheduling practice time between two instruments to meet weekly goals
  - Students balancing study time between subjects to meet both homework and test prep needs
  - Pet store owners mixing bird seed types to create a blend at a specific price point
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid systems with more than two equations or two unknowns
  - Don't introduce elimination method or matrix notation
  - Avoid coefficients requiring complex fraction arithmetic beyond basic operations
  - Don't use context requiring knowledge of advanced physics or chemistry
  - Avoid systems where coefficients are irrational numbers or complex decimals
