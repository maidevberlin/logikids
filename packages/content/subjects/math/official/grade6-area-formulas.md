name: Area Formulas
description: Deriving and applying area formulas for parallelograms, triangles, and trapezoids; calculating surface areas of simple solids using decomposition and complementation strategies
grade: 6
focus: Area formulas and surface area calculations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Derive the area formula for parallelograms through transformation to rectangles
  - Derive the area formula for triangles by relating them to parallelograms or rectangles
  - Derive the area formula for trapezoids using decomposition into known shapes
  - Identify and measure the relevant base and height dimensions for each shape
  - Apply area formulas flexibly to solve problems with different orientations
  - Calculate surface areas of cubes and cuboids by summing face areas
  - Use area formulas to compare and contrast different geometric figures
problem_types:
  - Parallelogram area
  - Triangle area
  - Trapezoid area
  - Identifying dimensions
  - Formula derivation
  - Surface area of cuboids
  - Shape comparison
  - Composite shapes
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct formula application with clearly labeled base and height
    - Simple whole number dimensions (under 20)
    - Standard orientations with horizontal base
  medium:
    - Identifying which measurements to use when multiple are shown
    - Shapes in non-standard orientations
    - Surface area with dimensions requiring calculation of opposite faces
  hard:
    - Decomposing irregular shapes into parallelograms, triangles, and trapezoids
    - Problems requiring multiple formula applications
    - Argumentative comparisons of areas (proving which is larger without calculating)
prerequisites:
  - grade5-area-perimeter-advanced
  - grade5-fractions-operations
real_world_context:
  - Calculating fabric needed for triangular sails or pennants
  - Determining paint quantities for walls and room surfaces
  - Finding land area for trapezoidal plots or triangular parks
  - Calculating material costs for parallelogram-shaped roof panels
  - Estimating wrapping paper needed for boxes of different sizes
  - A kite maker calculating fabric for diamond-shaped kites
  - Tiling a kitchen backsplash with parallelogram tiles
  - Computing area for a trapezoidal garden bed
  - A sign maker pricing triangular warning signs
  - Calculating canvas needed for a triangular tent section
  - Flooring costs for rooms with angled walls
  - A chef cutting sandwich triangles for catering events
anti_patterns:
  - Don't confuse side length with height (height must be perpendicular)
  - Avoid using diagonal measurements as height
  - Don't apply rectangle formulas directly to parallelograms without justification
  - Avoid problems where the correct base-height pair is ambiguous
  - Don't mix area units (cm²) with length units (cm) in the same calculation
