name: Introduction to Probability
description: Understand probability as a measure of likelihood, explore experimental vs theoretical probability, and calculate simple probabilities
grade: 6
ages:
  - 11
  - 12
focus: Data, Probability and Statistics - Probability Fundamentals
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Understand probability as a measure between 0 and 1 representing the likelihood of an event occurring
  - Distinguish between impossible events (probability 0), certain events (probability 1), and events with intermediate probability
  - Conduct simple probability experiments and record results systematically
  - Calculate theoretical probability for simple events using favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes
  - Compare experimental results with theoretical probabilities and understand why they may differ
  - Use probability language precisely (certain, likely, unlikely, impossible)
  - Apply probability understanding to everyday situations and simple decision-making contexts
prerequisites:
  - grade3-data-probability-and-combinatorics
real_world_context: Probability is fundamental to understanding risk, making predictions, and decision-making in everyday life. Students encounter probability when playing games (what are the chances of rolling a 6?), weather predictions (what is the probability of rain?), sports (what are the odds a team wins?), genetics (probability of inheriting traits), medical testing (probability of accuracy), lotteries, and fair games. Grade 6 students develop intuition about likelihood through hands-on experiments and begin to understand that both experimental and theoretical perspectives provide useful information. Mastery of probability basics forms the foundation for statistical reasoning, risk assessment, and understanding uncertainty in higher mathematics and real-world applications in science, finance, and everyday decision-making.

age_guidelines:
  11:
    - Use simple probability scenarios with obvious outcomes (dice with 6 faces, coins, simple spinners, bags with 2-3 colors)
    - Provide visual representations for all probability situations (pictures of items, spinner diagrams, color swatches)
    - Use smaller numbers of trials for experiments (20-50 rather than 100+)
    - Focus on comparing probabilities qualitatively before calculating numerical values
    - Use whole number counts rather than fractions initially, moving to simple fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6)
    - Provide explicit step-by-step structure for problem-solving
    - Emphasize concrete, touchable contexts (physical manipulatives, real objects)
    - Use simple probability language and define it explicitly
    - Include direct verification (students can physically check if spinner is fair by examining proportions)
  12:
    - Work with more complex probability setups (two dice, more colors/options, less uniform distributions)
    - Reduce reliance on visual representations, using numerical descriptions increasingly
    - Work with larger numbers of trials (100+ trials) to observe convergence
    - Calculate probabilities using fractions and decimals
    - Compare multiple events and order by probability
    - Analyze why experimental and theoretical probability differ
    - Work with more abstract scenarios (probabilities from descriptions without physical devices)
    - Understand that more trials generally lead to results closer to theoretical probability
    - Consider multiple factors affecting probability (size, number, proportion)
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single, equally likely outcomes (standard die, fair coin, simple spinner)
    - Small number of favorable outcomes (e.g., "What's the probability of rolling a 6?" not "What's the probability of rolling an even number?")
    - Experiments with 20-40 trials
    - Simple fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6) for probability
    - Comparing two probabilities visually or numerically
    - Recognizing impossible (0) and certain (1) events
    - Interpreting experimental results with direct visual comparison to theoretical
    - Using probability language for simple, familiar scenarios
  medium:
    - Multiple favorable outcomes (e.g., "What's the probability of rolling an even number?")
    - Unequal outcomes in visual representations (spinners with unequal sections, bags with different proportions)
    - Experiments with 50-80 trials and analysis of deviation from expected
    - Fractions including fifths, eighths, tenths where they arise naturally
    - Understanding that more trials generally give results closer to theoretical probability
    - Simple two-outcome compound experiments (two coins, coin and die)
    - Designing modifications to games to change fairness
    - Predicting approximate outcomes given probability information
  hard:
    - Complex compound events (rolling two dice, multiple draws without replacement)
    - Complex visual representations requiring proportion interpretation
    - Large samples (100+ trials) and statistical analysis of deviation
    - Reducing fractions to understand equivalent probabilities
    - Identifying when outcomes are not equally likely from given information
    - Understanding conditional probability intuitively ("If you already drew one red ball, does that change the probability of the next draw?")
    - Analyzing unfair games and calculating how unfair they are
    - Complex word problems requiring multiple steps and probability reasoning
