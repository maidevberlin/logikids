  - Apply the quadratic formula in abc form (ax² + bx + c = 0)
  - Solve quadratic equations by completing the square
  - Use the discriminant to determine the number of solutions
  - Model and solve real-world optimization and application problems
  - Verify solutions by substitution into the original equation
problem_types:
  - Solve by factoring
  - Solve using p-q formula
  - Solve using abc formula
  - Complete the square
  - Discriminant analysis

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple quadratic equations with integer solutions
    - Equations requiring only factoring or basic formula application
    - Discriminants clearly positive, zero, or negative
  medium:
    - Equations requiring formula selection or completing the square
    - Mixed integer and rational solutions
    - Real-world problems with clear mathematical structure
  hard:
    - Complex equations requiring transformation before solving
