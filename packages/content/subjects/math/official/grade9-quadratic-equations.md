name: Quadratic Equations
description: Solving quadratic equations using factoring, completing the square, and quadratic formulas (p-q and abc form). Understanding the discriminant and applying solutions to real-world problems.
grade: 9
focus: Algebraic problem-solving and equation solving
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Solve quadratic equations by factoring expressions
  - Apply the quadratic formula in p-q form (x² + px + q = 0)
  - Apply the quadratic formula in abc form (ax² + bx + c = 0)
  - Solve quadratic equations by completing the square
  - Use the discriminant to determine the number of solutions
  - Model and solve real-world optimization and application problems
  - Verify solutions by substitution into the original equation
problem_types:
  - Solve by factoring
  - Solve using p-q formula
  - Solve using abc formula
  - Complete the square
  - Discriminant analysis
  - Word problem modeling
  - Solution verification
  - Mixed method selection
  - Zero product property
  - Optimization problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple quadratic equations with integer solutions
    - Equations requiring only factoring or basic formula application
    - Discriminants clearly positive, zero, or negative
  medium:
    - Equations requiring formula selection or completing the square
    - Mixed integer and rational solutions
    - Real-world problems with clear mathematical structure
  hard:
    - Complex equations requiring transformation before solving
    - Optimization problems with multiple constraints
    - Problems requiring interpretation of discriminant in context
real_world_context:
  - Calculating projectile motion trajectories in physics (throwing, launching)
  - Finding optimal dimensions for maximum area or volume in construction
  - Determining break-even points in business and economics
  - Computing distances and times in motion problems with acceleration
  - Solving geometric problems involving areas and perimeters
prerequisites:
  - grade7-linear-equations
  - grade7-algebraic-terms
  - grade8-fractional-equations
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid equations requiring complex or imaginary number solutions
  - Don't use coefficients that result in irrational discriminants
  - Avoid word problems with ambiguous or unclear mathematical relationships
  - Don't mix multiple unrelated mathematical concepts in one problem
  - Avoid numbers that make mental calculation or estimation impossible
