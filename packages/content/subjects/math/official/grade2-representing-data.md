# Representing Data

Generate a task where {{name}} creates or interprets data representations appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Use varied contexts and representation types:

**Tally Charts:**
- Create tasks involving tally marks to count and organize data
- Example: "Students voted for their favorite season. Make a tally chart: Spring got $7$ votes, Summer got $12$ votes, Fall got $5$ votes, Winter got $9$ votes."
- Use the format: $||||$ $||$ for 7 items
- Ask questions like "Which category has the most/least?"

**Simple Tables:**
- Present data in table format and ask students to read or complete them
- Example: "This table shows fruit sold at a market:"

| Fruit | Number Sold |
|-------|-------------|
| Apples | $15$ |
| Bananas | $23$ |
| Oranges | $18$ |

- Ask: "How many more bananas than apples were sold?"

**Bar Charts (Pictorial):**
- Describe simple bar charts where students read information
- Example: "This bar chart shows books read by four students. Each bar shows the number of books. Anna: $6$ books, Ben: $4$ books, Clara: $9$ books, David: $5$ books."
- Ask questions about comparisons and totals

**Creating Representations:**
- Give raw data and ask students to organize it into a chosen format
- Example: "The weather last week was: Monday sunny, Tuesday rainy, Wednesday sunny, Thursday sunny, Friday cloudy, Saturday rainy, Sunday sunny. Create a table showing how many days were sunny, rainy, and cloudy."

**Pet/Animal Surveys:**
- Use familiar contexts like favorite animals or pets owned
- Example: "A class surveyed their pets. Make a tally chart: $8$ students have dogs, $5$ have cats, $3$ have fish, $2$ have birds."

**Food Preferences:**
- Survey results about favorite foods, drinks, or snacks
- Example: "Students chose their favorite lunch: $14$ chose pizza, $9$ chose pasta, $11$ chose sandwich. Show this in a table."

**Classroom Data:**
- Data about school supplies, books, colors, etc.
- Example: "Count the crayons: $13$ red, $8$ blue, $15$ green, $6$ yellow. Create a tally chart and identify which color has the most."

**Extracting Information:**
- Present a completed chart/table and ask multiple questions
- Example: "Look at this table showing goals scored by different teams. Which team scored the most? How many goals were scored in total?"

**Comparative Questions:**
- Ask students to find differences, sums, or rankings
- "How many more _____ than _____?"
- "Which has the least/most?"
- "What is the total of all _____?"

Use clear tables with markdown formatting. Keep numbers appropriate for grade 2 (typically 1-30). Use familiar, concrete contexts that 7-8 year olds encounter in daily life.
