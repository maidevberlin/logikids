id: grade10-exponential-functions
name: Exponential Functions and Growth
description: Exponential functions of the form b·aˣ, exponential growth and decay models, and comparison with linear growth
grade: 10
focus: Exponential functions and growth models
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Describe and visualize characteristics of exponential growth and decay
  - Distinguish exponential growth from linear growth through graphs and tables
  - Analyze functions of form b·aˣ including y-intercept, asymptotes, and monotonicity
  - Explain how parameters a and b affect the graph behavior
  - Model real-world scenarios such as population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest
  - Solve application problems graphically and algebraically using exponential functions
problem_types:
  - Growth vs decay identification
  - Graph interpretation
  - Parameter analysis
  - Exponential vs linear comparison
  - Growth factor calculation
  - Real-world modeling
  - Equation from context
  - Asymptote determination
  - Doubling/halving time
  - Value prediction
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Numbers with base a as simple whole numbers (2, 3, 5) or unit fractions (1/2, 1/3)
    - Exponents between -3 and 5
    - Initial values b between 1 and 1000
  medium:
    - Decimal bases like 1.5, 0.8, 2.5
    - Exponents between -5 and 10
    - Initial values requiring scientific notation for large populations
  hard:
    - Context requiring conversion of percentage growth to base a (e.g., 15% growth → a = 1.15)
    - Multi-step problems combining exponential with algebraic manipulation
    - Problems requiring comparison of multiple exponential functions
real_world_context:
  - Bacteria populations doubling every hour in a petri dish
  - Radioactive substances decaying with half-lives of days or years
  - Compound interest on savings accounts or loans
  - Viral social media posts spreading exponentially through networks
  - Medicine concentration decreasing exponentially in the bloodstream
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using both exponential growth and decay in the same problem
  - Don't use bases close to 1 (e.g., 0.95 to 1.05) without clear context
  - Avoid mixing fractional and percentage representations of growth rates
  - Don't present tables where the pattern could be linear or quadratic
  - Avoid contexts requiring logarithms to solve (covered in next concept)
prerequisites:
  - grade8-functions-basics
  - grade8-linear-functions
  - grade9-power-functions
version: 1
version_notes: Initial version based on KMK curriculum for Grade 10
