difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct calculation of percentage value (20% of 50)
    - Simple discounts with whole number percentages
    - Base values up to 1000
  medium:
    - Finding base value or percentage rate from given information
    - Interest calculations over one time period
    - Percentage changes requiring two-step calculation
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining discounts or interest
    - Distinguishing percent from percentage points in real contexts
    - Problems requiring identification of which value is unknown (Grundwert, Prozentsatz, or Prozentwert)
prerequisites:
  - grade6-fractions-basics
  - grade6-decimal-fractions
  - grade5-decimals
real_world_context:
  - Store sales advertise discounts as percentages off the original price
  - Banks calculate interest on savings accounts and loans using percentage rates
  - News reports describe changes in statistics using percent and percentage points
  - Tax calculations use percentages to determine amounts owed or refunded
  - Sports statistics show win rates and improvement percentages for teams and players
  - Restaurant tips calculated as percentages of the bill total
  - Battery and download progress shown as completion percentages
  - Nutrition labels displaying percentages of daily recommended values
  - School grades converted to percentage scores
  - Humidity levels in weather reports as percentages
  - Commission earned by salespeople as percentage of sales
  - Crowd capacity at venues shown as percentage filled
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid percentage values above 100% (except in clearly labeled growth contexts)
  - Don't introduce compound interest or multi-period calculations
  - Avoid ambiguous problems where base value is unclear
  - Don't use more than two percentage operations in sequence
  - Avoid contexts requiring VAT calculations with multiple rates
