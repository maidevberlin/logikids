# All Operations with Decimal Numbers

You will create tasks that help students master all four operations with decimal numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and working with powers of ten. Use LaTeX for all decimal notation and show step-by-step calculations where appropriate.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Addition of Decimals
Students add decimal numbers by aligning decimal points.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$
- Add: ${{a}} + {{b}} + {{c}}$
- What is the sum of ${{decimal1}}$ and ${{decimal2}}$?
- ${{x}} + {{y}} = $ ?

**Example with alignment:**
$$\begin{array}{r}
  3.45 \\
+ 12.7 \\
\hline
  16.15
\end{array}$$

### 2. Subtraction of Decimals
Students subtract decimal numbers by aligning decimal points.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{num1}} - {{num2}}$
- Subtract ${{b}}$ from ${{a}}$.
- What is ${{decimal1}} - {{decimal2}}$?
- ${{x}} - {{y}} = $ ?

**Example:**
$$\begin{array}{r}
  15.6 \\
-  8.73 \\
\hline
   6.87
\end{array}$$

### 3. Multiplication of Decimals
Students multiply decimals and count total decimal places in the result.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{num1}} \times {{num2}}$
- Multiply: ${{a}} \times {{b}}$
- What is the product of ${{decimal1}}$ and ${{decimal2}}$?
- ${{x}} \times {{y}} = $ ?

**Example with explanation:**
$$3.45 \times 2.1$$

Step 1: Multiply as whole numbers: $345 \times 21 = 7245$

Step 2: Count decimal places: $3.45$ has 2 places, $2.1$ has 1 place → total 3 places

Step 3: Place decimal point: $7.245$

### 4. Division by Whole Numbers
Students divide decimals by whole numbers.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{decimal}} \div {{wholeNumber}}$
- Divide ${{a}}$ by ${{b}}$.
- What is ${{dividend}} \div {{divisor}}$?
- ${{x}} \div {{y}} = $ ?

**Example:**
$$8.4 \div 3 = 2.8$$

### 5. Division by Decimals
Students divide by decimals by converting to division by whole numbers.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{num1}} \div {{num2}}$
- Divide ${{a}}$ by ${{b}}$.
- What is ${{dividend}} \div {{divisor}}$?
- ${{x}} \div {{y}} = $ ?

**Example with steps:**
$$8.4 \div 0.3$$

Step 1: Multiply both numbers by 10 to make divisor a whole number:
$$84 \div 3 = 28$$

Result: $8.4 \div 0.3 = 28$

### 6. Multiplying by Powers of Ten
Students shift decimal point right when multiplying by 10, 100, 1000, etc.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{decimal}} \times 10$
- What is ${{num}} \times 100$?
- ${{value}} \times 1000 = $ ?
- Multiply ${{x}}$ by ${{powerOfTen}}$.

**Rules:**
| Operation | Decimal Point Movement |
|-----------|----------------------|
| × 10 | Move 1 place right |
| × 100 | Move 2 places right |
| × 1000 | Move 3 places right |

**Examples:**
- $4.56 \times 10 = 45.6$
- $4.56 \times 100 = 456$
- $4.56 \times 1000 = 4560$

### 7. Dividing by Powers of Ten
Students shift decimal point left when dividing by 10, 100, 1000, etc.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: ${{decimal}} \div 10$
- What is ${{num}} \div 100$?
- ${{value}} \div 1000 = $ ?
- Divide ${{x}}$ by ${{powerOfTen}}$.

**Rules:**
| Operation | Decimal Point Movement |
|-----------|----------------------|
| ÷ 10 | Move 1 place left |
| ÷ 100 | Move 2 places left |
| ÷ 1000 | Move 3 places left |

**Examples:**
- $45.6 \div 10 = 4.56$
- $45.6 \div 100 = 0.456$
- $45.6 \div 1000 = 0.0456$

### 8. Mixed Operations and Word Problems
Students solve multi-step problems combining different operations.

**Examples:**
- Calculate: $({{a}} + {{b}}) \times {{c}}$
- A book costs ${{price1}}$ euros and a pen costs ${{price2}}$ euros. How much do ${{quantity}}$ books and ${{quantity2}}$ pens cost in total?
- Tom has ${{money}}$ euros. He buys ${{items}}$ items at ${{price}}$ euros each. How much money does he have left?
- Calculate: ${{num1}} \times {{num2}} + {{num3}} \div {{num4}}$

**Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):**
1. Parentheses/Brackets
2. Exponents/Orders
3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

### 9. Rounding Decimals
Students round decimals to specified decimal places.

**Examples:**
- Round ${{decimal}}$ to one decimal place.
- Round ${{number}}$ to two decimal places.
- Round ${{value}}$ to the nearest tenth.
- Round ${{x}}$ to the nearest hundredth.

**Example:**
Round $3.456$ to two decimal places:
Look at the third decimal place (6). Since $6 \geq 5$, round up: $3.46$

### 10. Comparing and Ordering Decimals
Students compare decimals and arrange them in order.

**Examples:**
- Which is larger: ${{num1}}$ or ${{num2}}$?
- Order these decimals from smallest to largest: ${{a}}$, ${{b}}$, ${{c}}$, ${{d}}$
- Compare using <, >, or =: ${{x}}$ ___ ${{y}}$
- Arrange in descending order: ${{decimal1}}$, ${{decimal2}}$, ${{decimal3}}$

**Strategy:** Compare digit by digit from left to right, starting with the whole number part.
