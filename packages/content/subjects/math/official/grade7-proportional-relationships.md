name: Proportional and Inversely Proportional Relationships
description: Understanding proportional relationships where two quantities change at a constant ratio (y=kx), distinguishing direct from inverse proportionality, applying the Dreisatz method systematically, and representing relationships through equations, tables, and graphs (German curriculum focus on algebraic thinking)
grade: 7
ages:
  - 12
  - 13
focus: Algebraic Thinking and Functional Relationships (Algebraisches Denken und funktionale Zusammenhänge)
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Recognize and identify direct proportional relationships in tables, graphs, and real-world contexts
  - Distinguish between proportional and non-proportional relationships
  - Determine the constant of proportionality (k) from various representations
  - Apply direct proportionality formula (y = kx) to solve problems
  - Recognize and identify inverse proportional relationships (y = k/x)
  - Distinguish between direct and inverse proportionality
  - Master the Dreisatz method for solving proportional problems
  - Create and interpret graphs of proportional relationships
  - Solve real-world problems involving proportional and inverse proportional relationships
  - Apply proportionality concepts to scaling, ratios, and rate problems
prerequisites:
  - grade4-algebraic-thinking
  - grade6-ratios-and-rates
  - fraction-operations
real_world_context: Proportional and inverse proportional relationships are fundamental to understanding real-world phenomena. Direct proportionality appears in cooking (ingredient ratios), travel (distance = speed × time), shopping (total cost = price per unit × quantity), map scales, recipe adjustments, currency exchange, and physics (force = mass × acceleration). Inverse proportionality appears in work scenarios (more workers complete a task faster), speed and time relationships (faster speed means less travel time), lighting intensity (farther from light source = dimmer), and resource allocation (more people sharing items = fewer items per person). Students encounter these relationships constantly in science (physics, chemistry), economics, geography, and everyday decision-making.

age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Focus primarily on direct proportionality (delay or minimize inverse proportionality)
    - Use whole number relationships and simple fractions in proportional constants
    - Emphasize concrete contexts (shopping, recipe scaling, simple unit conversion)
    - Provide clearer visual supports (complete tables, labeled graphs)
    - Dreisatz problems with straightforward relationships (price, time, distance)
    - Simpler numbers in constants (k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 1/2, 1/3)
    - Single-concept problems (identify proportionality OR find k OR solve using Dreisatz, not combined)
    - More explicit guidance about what to look for in tables and graphs
  13:
    - Include both direct and inverse proportionality with increasing frequency
    - Introduce decimal and more complex fractional proportional constants
    - Include less obvious contexts (currency exchange, speed with decimals, dilution ratios)
    - Reduce visual supports; require interpretation of minimal information
    - Dreisatz problems with more complex relationships and multiple steps
    - More varied constants including decimals and fractions (k = 1.5, 2.5, 3/4, 5/2)
    - Multi-concept problems requiring students to first identify the relationship type
    - Problems requiring comparison and reasoning about why a specific method applies
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify proportional relationships in clearly organized tables with whole number data
    - Find constant of proportionality when already told the relationship is proportional
    - Simple Dreisatz problems (4 corresponds to 12, what does 8 correspond to?)
    - Read proportional values directly from graphs
    - Calculate proportional values using given formula y = kx
    - Simple contexts with familiar relationships (price per item, distance per hour)
    - Whole number constants (k = 2, 3, 4, 5)
    - Single-step solutions
  medium:
    - Determine whether a table represents a proportional relationship
    - Find constant of proportionality and write equation from various representations
    - Multi-step Dreisatz problems with fractions or decimals

    - Distinguish between proportional and non-proportional relationships
    - Mixed whole numbers and decimals in constants
    - Combine proportionality with other concepts (percentages, unit conversion)
    - Word problems requiring setup and solution using proportionality
    - Inverse proportionality recognition and simple application
  hard:
    - Complex analysis of multiple relationships to identify which is proportional
