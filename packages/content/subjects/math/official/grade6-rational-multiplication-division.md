name: Multiplying and Dividing Rational Numbers
description: Computing products and quotients of fractions using meaningful representations, applying reciprocals for division, calculating powers with rational bases and natural or negative integer exponents, and using computational advantages to simplify calculations
grade: 6
focus: Multiplication and division with rational numbers
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Calculate products of fractions using meaningful visual and numerical representations
  - Calculate quotients of fractions by multiplying with the reciprocal
  - Compute powers with natural exponents and rational bases
  - Interpret negative integer exponents as reciprocal fractions (e.g., 2^-3 = 1/8)
  - Apply commutative and associative properties to simplify calculations
  - Multiply and divide mixed numbers by converting to improper fractions
  - Verify multiplication and division results through estimation and inverse operations
problem_types:
  - Fraction multiplication
  - Fraction division
  - Mixed number operations
  - Power calculation
  - Negative exponents
  - Reciprocal identification
  - Estimation verification
  - Multi-step calculation
  - Word problem solving
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Multiply fraction by whole number or unit fractions (1/2 × 3, 1/4 × 1/3)
    - Divide by whole numbers or find simple reciprocals
    - Powers with small bases and exponents up to 3 (e.g., (1/2)^2, (3/4)^3)
  medium:
    - Multiply/divide proper fractions with denominators up to 12
    - Mixed numbers requiring conversion to improper fractions
    - Powers with exponents up to 5, negative exponents from -1 to -3
  hard:
    - Multi-step problems combining multiplication and division
    - Complex mixed numbers with multiple operations
    - Powers with negative exponents requiring reciprocal understanding
prerequisites:
  - grade6-fractions-basics
  - grade5-fractions-operations
  - grade5-divisibility-prime-numbers
real_world_context:
  - Scaling recipes up or down by multiplying ingredient fractions (doubling 2/3 cup)
  - Dividing pizzas or cakes equally among people to find fractional shares
  - Calculating compound interest or repeated percentage changes using powers
  - Understanding scientific notation with negative exponents for small measurements
  - Sharing resources fairly by dividing total amounts by fractional portions
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid adding or subtracting during multiplication/division problems
  - Don't use denominators larger than 20 except in simplified results
  - Avoid exponents larger than 5 or negative exponents beyond -4
  - Don't introduce irrational results (keep answers as rational numbers)
  - Avoid word problems requiring multi-step order of operations with parentheses
