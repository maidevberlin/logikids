id: grade7-congruence-triangles
name: Congruence and Triangle Construction
description: Congruence theorems (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS) and constructing triangles from given elements
grade: 7
focus: Triangle congruence and construction
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Explain congruence intuitively as identical shape and size
  - Apply the SSS (side-side-side) congruence theorem
  - Apply the SAS (side-angle-side) congruence theorem
  - Apply the ASA (angle-side-angle) congruence theorem
  - Apply the AAS (angle-angle-side) congruence theorem
  - Determine whether triangles are constructible from given elements
  - Construct triangles using compass and straightedge from various defining elements
problem_types:
  - Identifying congruence theorem
  - Verifying triangle constructibility
  - Compass and straightedge construction
  - Proving triangle congruence
  - Identifying congruent triangles
  - Applying congruence to solve problems
  - Distinguishing hypothesis from conclusion
  - Special triangle construction
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify which congruence theorem applies to clearly marked figures
    - Determine if three given measurements can form a triangle
    - Recognize obviously congruent triangles in simple configurations
  medium:
    - Construct triangles given three specific measurements using compass and straightedge
    - Apply congruence theorems to find missing measurements
    - Prove two triangles are congruent using appropriate theorem
  hard:
    - Prove congruence in complex multi-triangle figures requiring auxiliary lines
    - Solve geometric modeling problems using congruence theorems
    - Construct special triangles (isosceles, equilateral) satisfying multiple conditions
prerequisites:
  - grade7-symmetry-constructions
  - grade6-angles-advanced
real_world_context:
  - Engineers use congruence principles to ensure structural components are identical and interchangeable in construction and manufacturing
  - Architects apply triangle congruence theorems when designing stable roof trusses and bridge supports
  - Surveyors use triangle construction principles to measure distances and map terrain without directly measuring inaccessible distances
  - Quality control inspectors verify that manufactured parts are congruent to specifications using geometric measurements
  - Navigation systems use triangulation based on congruence principles to determine precise locations from multiple reference points
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using SSA (side-side-angle) which does not guarantee congruence
  - Don't present ambiguous cases where multiple triangles could be constructed
  - Avoid measurements requiring precision beyond compass and straightedge
  - Don't mix similar triangles with congruent triangles in the same problem
  - Avoid figures where congruence depends on unmarked equal angles or sides
