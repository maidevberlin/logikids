id: grade6-proportionality
name: Proportionality and Ratios
description: Understanding ratios as comparisons, recognizing proportional relationships, using ratio tables and the rule of three, and distinguishing proportional from non-proportional situations
grade: 6
focus: Proportional reasoning and ratios
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Express relationships between quantities as ratios in different forms (a:b, a/b, a to b)
  - Recognize and verify proportional relationships in tables, graphs, and word problems
  - Use ratio tables to find equivalent ratios and missing values
  - Apply the rule of three (Dreisatz) to solve proportional problems
  - Distinguish between proportional and non-proportional relationships
  - Interpret unit rates and use them to compare quantities
problem_types:
  - Ratio notation conversion
  - Equivalent ratio identification
  - Ratio table completion
  - Rule of three application
  - Unit rate calculation
  - Proportionality verification
  - Real-world proportion problems
  - Ratio comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple whole number ratios up to 1:10 or 10:1
    - Ratio tables with obvious multiplication patterns (×2, ×3, ×5)
    - Direct unit rate problems with whole number results
  medium:
    - Ratios requiring simplification or finding common factors
    - Rule of three problems with two-step calculations
    - Comparing ratios that require common denominators or cross multiplication
  hard:
    - Complex ratio problems requiring multiple conversions
    - Distinguishing proportional from non-proportional in ambiguous contexts
    - Multi-step problems combining ratios with other operations
prerequisites:
  - grade6-fractions-basics
  - grade5-divisibility-prime-numbers
  - grade5-decimals
real_world_context:
  - Mixing paint colors or recipe ingredients in specific ratios (2 parts red to 3 parts blue)
  - Calculating prices using unit rates at the grocery store (price per kilogram)
  - Scale models and maps showing distances in fixed ratios to real dimensions
  - Speed calculations relating distance and time proportionally
  - Currency exchange using conversion rates between different currencies
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid ratios with numbers larger than 100
  - Don't mix proportional and percentage problems in one task
  - Avoid inverse proportionality (separate Grade 7 concept)
  - Don't use decimal ratios without clear context
  - Avoid ambiguous wording that confuses ratios with fractions
version: 1
