description: Reading analog and digital clocks in 24-hour format; converting between time units; calculating time durations and elapsed time; working with calendars including days, weeks, months, and years
grade: 4
focus: Time measurement, calculation, and calendar skills
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Read and interpret analog and digital clocks in 24-hour format
  - Convert between time units (hours, minutes, seconds) accurately
  - Calculate time durations and elapsed time across different periods
  - Add and subtract time spans with regrouping
  - Work with calendar concepts (days, weeks, months, years)
  - Calculate days between dates and solve calendar problems
  - Solve real-world word problems involving time and schedules
problem_types:
  - Clock reading
  - Time unit conversion
  - Duration calculation
  - Time addition
  - Time subtraction
  - Calendar date calculation
  - Days between dates
  - Schedule planning
  - Time word problems
  - Time zone comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Clock reading to nearest 5 minutes
    - Simple conversions (hours to minutes, no mixed units)
    - Duration calculations within same day, under 3 hours
  medium:
    - Clock reading to exact minute, including 24-hour format
    - Mixed unit conversions (e.g., 90 minutes to hours and minutes)
    - Durations spanning multiple days or with regrouping (across noon/midnight)
  hard:
    - Complex time calculations with multiple steps and regrouping
    - Calendar problems spanning multiple months or years
    - Word problems requiring inference of unstated information
prerequisites:
  - grade3-time-and-duration
real_world_context:
  - Planning daily schedules and managing appointment times
  - Calculating travel durations for trips and commutes
  - Understanding TV program schedules and movie start times
  - Tracking sports event durations and timing
  - Planning birthday parties and calculating days until events
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid time zones beyond simple comparison (too complex for grade 4)
  - Don't use 12-hour AM/PM format exclusively; prioritize 24-hour format
  - Avoid ambiguous date formats (use day-month-year clearly)
  - Don't combine time with fractions or decimals (e.g., 2.5 hours as decimal)
  - Avoid historical dates or contexts unfamiliar to 9-10 year olds
