# Collecting and Representing Data

Generate tasks that teach students to plan surveys, collect data systematically, and create or interpret bar charts and column charts.

## Task Variations

### 1. Reading Bar Charts
Present a bar chart and ask interpretation questions:
- **Basic Reading**: "How many students chose {{category}}?"
- **Comparison**: "Which {{item}} was most/least popular?"
- **Calculation**: "How many more students chose {{option1}} than {{option2}}?"

Example chart data:
| Favorite Sport | Students |
|----------------|----------|
| Soccer         | 12       |
| Basketball     | 8        |
| Swimming       | 6        |
| Tennis         | 4        |

Questions: "How many students voted? Which sport is most popular? How many more chose soccer than tennis?"

### 2. Reading Column Charts
Interpret vertical bar (column) charts:
- **Data Points**: "On which day did the library have {{number}} visitors?"
- **Trends**: "Which day had the most/least {{measured_item}}?"
- **Total**: "What is the total number of {{items}} across all {{categories}}?"

Example: Books borrowed per day
- Monday: 15, Tuesday: 22, Wednesday: 18, Thursday: 25, Friday: 20
- "Which day had most borrowings? How many total books borrowed this week?"

### 3. Creating Bar Charts from Data
Given data in table form, students create a chart:
- **Problem**: "Create a bar chart for this data about {{topic}}"
- **Skills**: Label axes, choose scale, draw accurate bars

| Fruit     | Votes |
|-----------|-------|
| Apple     | {{n1}}|
| Banana    | {{n2}}|
| Orange    | {{n3}}|
| Grapes    | {{n4}}|

"Draw a bar chart showing this favorite fruit survey. Label both axes and give your chart a title."

### 4. Planning Surveys
Design survey questions and methods:
- **Question Design**: "You want to find out {{topic}}. Write 3 good survey questions"
- **Sample Size**: "You're surveying {{number}} people about {{topic}}. How will you record answers?"
- **Categories**: "List 4-5 answer choices for the question: {{survey_question}}"

Examples:
- "What is your favorite school subject?" (Math, Reading, Science, Art, PE)
- "How do you get to school?" (Walk, Car, Bus, Bike)

### 5. Collecting Data from Tally Marks
Convert tally marks to numbers and charts:
- Present tally marks for {{categories}}
- **Task**: "Count the tallies and create a bar chart"
- **Analysis**: "Which category has the most? How many total?"

Weather last month:
- Sunny: |||| |||| |||  (13)
- Cloudy: |||| ||||      (9)
- Rainy: |||| ||          (7)
- Snowy: |||              (3)

### 6. Comparing Two Data Sets
Work with multiple charts:
- **Two Classes**: "Class A and Class B both surveyed favorite colors. Compare their results"
- **Before/After**: "This chart shows recycling before and after a campaign. What changed?"
- **Analysis**: "Which group has more {{item}}? What's the difference?"

| Color  | Class A | Class B |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Blue   | 8       | 6       |
| Red    | 5       | 9       |
| Green  | 7       | 4       |

### 7. Finding Chart Errors
Present charts with mistakes:
- **Missing Labels**: "What's wrong with this chart?"
- **Incorrect Data**: "The chart shows {{wrong_value}}, but the table says {{correct_value}}"
- **Scale Issues**: "Why is this chart confusing to read?"

Present a bar chart where:
- Axes aren't labeled
- Bars don't match data table
- Scale jumps unevenly (0, 5, 15, 20, 40)

### 8. Survey Projects
Complete multi-step data projects:
- **Full Process**:
  1. Choose a topic: "What is your favorite {{category}}?"
  2. Survey {{number}} people
  3. Record data in a table
  4. Create a bar chart
  5. Write 3 observations about results

- **Predictions**: "Before surveying, predict which {{option}} will be most popular. Then collect data and check your prediction"

## Answer Requirements

Provide solutions that:
- Include properly labeled charts (title, axis labels, scale)
- Show accurate bar heights matching data
- Use tables to organize data before charting
- Explain how to count and compare values
- Suggest clear, simple survey questions appropriate for age group
