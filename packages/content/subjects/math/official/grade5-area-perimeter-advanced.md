name: Area and Perimeter - Advanced
description: Calculate area and perimeter of rectangles, squares, triangles, and composite shapes
grade: 5
focus: Measurement and geometric calculation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Calculate perimeter of rectangles and squares
  - Calculate area of rectangles and squares
  - Calculate area of triangles using base times height divided by 2
  - Decompose composite shapes into simpler shapes
  - Calculate area and perimeter of composite shapes
  - Solve problems with missing dimensions
problem_types:
  - Rectangle perimeter
  - Rectangle area
  - Square calculations
  - Triangle area
  - Composite shapes
  - Missing dimensions
  - Comparison problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single shapes with whole number dimensions under 20
    - Direct application of formulas
    - All dimensions provided
  medium:
    - Composite shapes made of 2 simple shapes
    - One missing dimension requiring calculation
    - Numbers up to 100
  hard:
    - Complex composite shapes with 3 or more parts
    - Multiple missing values requiring multi-step reasoning
    - Comparison of different shapes or solutions
real_world_context:
  - Calculating floor space for rooms and furniture placement
  - Planning gardens with fencing and planting areas
  - Determining paint needed for walls and surfaces
  - Designing sports fields and playground layouts
  - A farmer calculating land area for different crop sections
  - Wrapping presents and determining paper needed
  - Tiling a bathroom floor with square tiles
  - Planning a backyard patio with different shaped sections
  - A carpenter building a triangular shelf for a corner
  - Designing a composite-shaped swimming pool
  - Calculating fabric for L-shaped curtains
  - Planning walking paths through a park with various shaped zones
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid circles and curved shapes
  - Don't use decimal dimensions unless in money context
  - Avoid parallelograms and trapezoids
  - Don't require unit conversions within problems
  - Avoid composite shapes with more than 4 parts
prerequisites:
  - grade4-area-perimeter
  - grade4-measurement-units
  - grade3-multiplication-tables
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 4 to 12 items for better variety
