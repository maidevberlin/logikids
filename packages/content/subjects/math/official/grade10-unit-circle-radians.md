name: Unit Circle and Radian Measure
description: Unit circle with radius 1, radian measure as alternative to degrees, and sine/cosine values for special angles from 0 to 2π
grade: 10
focus: Unit circle and radian measure
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand radian measure as an alternative to degrees based on arc length
  - Convert between degrees and radians fluently using π radians = 180°
  - Visualize sine and cosine values on the unit circle for angles from 0 to 2π
  - Determine the signs of sine and cosine in each of the four quadrants
  - Find angles with given sine or cosine values using the unit circle and reference angles
  - Connect unit circle definitions to right triangle trigonometry ratios
  - Identify coordinates (cos θ, sin θ) for special angles on the unit circle
problem_types:
  - Degree to radian conversion
  - Radian to degree conversion
  - Quadrant identification
  - Sign determination
  - Special angle evaluation
  - Reference angle finding
  - Coordinate identification
  - Angle from sine/cosine
  - Arc length calculation
  - Multiple angle solutions
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Conversion between degrees and radians for multiples of 30° and 45° (π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2)
    - Identify quadrant for angles like π/3, 3π/4, 5π/6
    - Determine signs of sine and cosine in each quadrant
  medium:
    - Find sine and cosine values for all special angles (0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π)
    - Convert general angles like 150°, 225°, 330° to radians
    - Find reference angles for angles in any quadrant
  hard:
    - Find all angles in [0, 2π] with a given sine or cosine value
    - Solve problems requiring both unit circle and arc length (s = rθ)
    - Determine angles using symmetry properties of the unit circle
real_world_context:
  - Ferris wheels rotating through angles measured in radians
  - Pendulum swings tracking angular displacement over time
  - Rotating machinery with angular positions specified in radians
  - Navigation systems using radians for directional bearings
  - Circular motion of planets and satellites with angles in radians
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid mixing degrees and radians in the same problem without clear labels
  - Don't ask for decimal approximations of exact values like √2/2 or √3/2
  - Avoid angles outside the range [0, 2π] without specifying multiple solutions
  - Don't use obscure angles that aren't multiples of π/6 or π/4
  - Avoid problems requiring calculator-based inverse trig (covered later)
