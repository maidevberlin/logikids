# Time Spans Extended

Generate tasks that help students work with time, including reading clocks to quarter hours, calculating durations, and converting between seconds, minutes, and hours.

## Task Variations

### 1. Reading Clock Times
Read analog or digital clocks with quarter-hour precision:
- **Quarter Hours**: "What time is shown: quarter past {{hour}}?"
- **Digital to Analog**: "Show {{digital_time}} on an analog clock"
- **Time Writing**: "Write this time in two ways: {{hour}}:{{minutes}}"

Examples:
- 3:15 = quarter past three = 15 minutes after 3
- 7:45 = quarter to eight = 15 minutes before 8
- 5:30 = half past five

### 2. Calculating Time Durations
Find elapsed time between two points:
- **Start to End**: "Activity starts at {{start}} and ends at {{end}}. How long does it last?"
- **Adding Time**: "If it's {{current_time}} now and we wait {{duration}}, what time will it be?"
- **Subtracting Time**: "The event ends at {{end_time}}. It lasted {{duration}}. When did it start?"

Examples:
- Start: 9:30 AM, End: 11:15 AM → Duration: $1 \text{ hour } 45 \text{ minutes}$
- Now: 2:00 PM, Wait: 2 hours 30 minutes → Then: 4:30 PM

### 3. Converting Time Units
Practice conversions between seconds, minutes, and hours:
- **Minutes to Seconds**: "{{minutes}} minutes = ___ seconds"
- **Hours to Minutes**: "{{hours}} hours and {{extra_minutes}} minutes = ___ minutes total"
- **Mixed Conversions**: "{{total_seconds}} seconds = ___ minutes and ___ seconds"

Conversion facts:
- $1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}$
- $1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}$
- $1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds}$

Examples:
- $5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds}$
- $2 \text{ hours } 20 \text{ minutes} = 120 + 20 = 140 \text{ minutes}$

### 4. Time Schedule Problems
Work with daily schedules:
- **School Day**: "School starts at {{start}}. You have {{num_lessons}} lessons of {{lesson_length}} each with a {{break_length}} break. When do you finish?"
- **TV Schedule**: "Show 1 is {{duration1}} long, Show 2 is {{duration2}} long. If Show 1 starts at {{time}}, when does Show 2 end?"

Example:
- Start: 8:00 AM
- 4 lessons × 45 minutes = 180 minutes = 3 hours
- 3 breaks × 15 minutes = 45 minutes
- Total: $3 \text{ hours } 45 \text{ minutes}$
- End: 11:45 AM

### 5. Time Before and After
Calculate times in the past or future:
- **How Long Ago**: "It's {{current_time}} now. An event happened {{duration}} ago. When was it?"
- **How Long Until**: "It's {{current_time}}. An event is in {{duration}}. When will it happen?"
- **Spanning Midnight**: "A movie starts at 10:30 PM and lasts 2 hours 15 minutes. When does it end?"

Example spanning midnight:
- Start: 10:30 PM
- Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes
- To midnight: 1 hour 30 minutes
- After midnight: 45 minutes
- End: 12:45 AM

### 6. Comparing Durations
Compare different time periods:
- **Longer/Shorter**: "Which is longer: {{duration1}} or {{duration2}}?"
- **Ordering**: "Put these times in order from shortest to longest: {{t1}}, {{t2}}, {{t3}}"
- **Time Differences**: "How much longer is {{duration1}} than {{duration2}}?"

Examples:
- Compare: 90 minutes vs. 1 hour 45 minutes (1h 45min is longer)
- Order: 75 seconds, 2 minutes, 100 seconds → 75s, 100s, 2min

### 7. Real-World Time Problems
Apply time skills to realistic scenarios:
- **Cooking**: "Recipe needs to cook for {{duration}}. You start at {{time}}. When will it be ready?"
- **Travel**: "Bus journey takes {{duration}}. Bus leaves at {{departure}}. What time do you arrive?"
- **Sports**: "Soccer game has two {{half_duration}} halves with a {{break}} break. Total game time?"

Example:
- Recipe: 1 hour 20 minutes
- Start: 3:45 PM
- Ready: 5:05 PM

### 8. Time Patterns and Sequences
Work with regular time intervals:
- **Repeating Events**: "A bell rings every {{interval}}. It rang at {{time1}}. When will it ring next 3 times?"
- **Schedules**: "Buses leave every {{frequency}}. One left at {{time}}. List the next 4 departure times"

Example:
- Bell rings every 15 minutes
- First ring: 9:00 AM
- Next rings: 9:15, 9:30, 9:45, 10:00

## Answer Requirements

Provide solutions that:
- Show time calculations step by step
- Use both digital (3:45) and word (quarter to four) formats
- Include visual clock representations where helpful
- Explain conversion factors (60 seconds/minute, 60 minutes/hour)
- Account for AM/PM and crossing midnight when relevant
- Use tables for multi-step schedule problems
