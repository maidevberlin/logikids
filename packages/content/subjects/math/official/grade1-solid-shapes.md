name: Solid Shapes
description: >-
  Identifying and naming 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, cuboid) and
  relating them to real-world objects
grade: 1
focus: Three-dimensional geometry and spatial awareness
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and name common 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, cuboid)
  - Describe basic properties of 3D shapes (flat or curved surfaces)
  - Recognize 3D shapes in the environment and everyday objects
  - Sort and classify 3D objects by their shape characteristics
  - Compare and distinguish between different 3D shapes
real_world_context:
  - Identifying shapes of toys, sports balls, and building blocks
  - Recognizing shapes in food packaging like boxes, cans, and containers
  - Finding shapes in buildings and structures like towers, houses, and bridges
  - Sorting household objects by their shape characteristics
  - A dragon hoarding treasures shaped like cubes, spheres, and cylinders
  - Ice cream cones as cones and scoops as spheres at a summer fair
  - Party hats shaped like cones and gift boxes shaped like cubes
  - A builder stacking different shaped blocks to construct a castle
  - Spotting cylindrical candles and spherical ornaments during holidays
  - Camping supplies like cylindrical flashlights and cube-shaped coolers
  - Musical instruments with 3D shapes like cylindrical drums and cube-shaped boxes
  - Fruits and vegetables with different shapes (round oranges, cylindrical cucumbers)
problem_types:
  - Shape Identification
  - Real Object Matching
  - Property Description
  - Shape Sorting
  - Shape Comparison
  - Missing Shape
  - Shape Hunt
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Identify basic shapes from clear images (cube, sphere, cylinder)
    - Match simple real objects to their shape names
    - Focus on 2-3 shapes at a time
  medium:
    - Work with all five shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, cone, cuboid)
    - Identify shapes from different orientations
    - Compare two shapes based on their properties
  hard:
    - Identify shapes in complex real-world contexts
    - Sort multiple objects by shape characteristics
    - Describe why an object matches a particular shape
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid technical terms like faces, edges, vertices, or base
  - Don't use shapes beyond the five core shapes for grade 1
  - Avoid abstract or unfamiliar objects - use everyday items
  - Don't ask about measurements or counting surfaces
  - Avoid pyramid - it's introduced in grade 3
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 4 to 12 items for better variety
