grade: 7
ages:
  - 12
  - 13
focus: Inequality notation, solving simple inequalities, solution sets on number lines
difficulty: medium
version: 1
version_notes: Migrated from prose-based format to frontmatter-only format. Extracted problem types, age guidelines, and difficulty guidelines from original instructional content.
learning_objectives:
  - Understand and use inequality symbols (< , > , ≤ , ≥) correctly
  - Solve simple linear inequalities with one variable
  - Represent solutions on a number line using open and closed circles
  - Understand that multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality
  - Model real-world constraints with inequalities
  - Write and interpret inequalities from context
  - Verify solutions to inequalities through substitution
  - Distinguish between strict (<, >) and non-strict (≤, ≥) inequalities
prerequisites:
  - integers-negative-numbers
  - grade4-algebraic-thinking
real_world_context: Speed limits (≤ maximum speed), age restrictions (≥ minimum age), budget constraints (≤ maximum budget), temperature ranges (weather forecasts), weight restrictions (elevators, bridges), profit margins (≥ minimum profit), inventory levels (≥ minimum stock), payment limits (≤ credit card limit), test scores (≥ passing grade), height restrictions (amusement park rides)
problem_types:
  - Symbol meaning
  - Number line plots
  - Addition/subtraction solving
  - Multiplication/division solving
  - Negative multipliers
  - Solution verification
  - Context translation
  - Constraint modeling
age_guidelines:
  12:
    - Use concrete number line representations with clear visual supports
    - Start with inequalities solvable by addition/subtraction only
    - Use integer coefficients and integer solutions initially
    - Emphasize the visual meaning of inequality symbols through comparison activities
    - Use abundant real-world contexts (age limits, height restrictions, score minimums)
    - Avoid multiplication/division by negatives initially; introduce gradually
    - Include visual scaffolding showing how to translate words to symbols
    - Focus on understanding what the solution set means rather than algebraic mechanics
  13:
    - Progress to inequalities with all four operations
    - Include problems requiring sign reversal (negative multipliers/divisors)
    - Work with rational coefficients and solutions
    - Require written explanation of the sign reversal rule and why it works
    - Include multi-step problems requiring planning and strategic thinking
    - Connect inequalities to linear equations and introduce concepts of linear programming contexts
    - Include problems with fractions and decimals
    - Require verification and justification of solutions using algebraic reasoning
    - Introduce discussion of why we flip the inequality when multiplying/dividing by negatives
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Inequalities solvable by single operations (addition or subtraction only)
    - Use small integers (roughly -20 to 20)
    - Integer solutions with clear number line representations
    - Clear, straightforward real-world contexts with obvious constraints
    - Simple substitution checks (values near the boundary)
    - Mostly familiar inequality symbols with explicit meaning stated
    - Single-step solution process
    - Closed circle or open circle, clearly indicated
  medium:
    - Two-step inequalities (e.g., 2x plus 5 is less than 11)
    - Work with integers from approximately -50 to 50
    - Introduce multiplication/division by positive numbers first
    - Include at least one problem with sign reversal (multiplying/dividing by negative)
    - Solution sets represented as x is less than a, x is less than or equal to b, etc.
    - Real-world contexts with moderate complexity
    - Require number line representation of solution sets
    - Test boundary values to verify solutions
    - Explain when and why to use open vs. closed circles
    - Verify one or two test points from the solution set
  hard:
    - Three or more step inequalities with mixed operations
    - Work with rational coefficients and negative numbers throughout
    - Multiple problems requiring sign reversal (various negative multipliers/divisors)
    - Solution sets with complex expressions (e.g., x is greater than or equal to negative three-fourths)
    - Abstract real-world scenarios requiring problem translation and planning
    - Compound inequalities or inequalities requiring reasoning about multiple constraints
    - Require algebraic justification for each step and explanation of sign reversal
    - Problems comparing solution sets or determining if solutions overlap
    - Work with fractions and decimals in coefficients and constants
    - Verify multiple test points and explain why the solution set is correct
