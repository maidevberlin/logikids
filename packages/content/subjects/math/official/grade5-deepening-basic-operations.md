# Deepening Basic Operations - Problem Variations

Generate tasks that reinforce order of operations, arithmetic laws, and strategic calculation methods.

## Variation 1: Order of Operations (Point before Stroke)
Calculate the following term step by step:

$${{a}} + {{b}} \times {{c}} = \, ?$$

**Remember:** Multiplication before addition!

**Example:** $45 + 23 \times 2$
Step 1: $23 \times 2 = 46$
Step 2: $45 + 46 = 91$

## Variation 2: Operations with Brackets
Calculate:

$$({{a}} + {{b}}) : {{c}} = \, ?$$

**Remember:** Calculate inside brackets first!

**Example:** $(120 + 80) : 4$
Step 1: $120 + 80 = 200$
Step 2: $200 : 4 = 50$

## Variation 3: Complex Term with Multiple Operations
Solve step by step and show your work:

$${{a}} \times {{b}} - {{c}} : {{d}} = \, ?$$

**Example:** $18 \times 5 - 48 : 6$
Step 1: $18 \times 5 = 90$
Step 2: $48 : 6 = 8$
Step 3: $90 - 8 = 82$

## Variation 4: Efficient Multiplication (Commutative Property)
Calculate efficiently by rearranging factors:

$${{a}} \times {{b}} \times {{c}} = \, ?$$

**Hint:** Look for pairs that are easy to multiply!

**Example:** $25 \times 17 \times 4$
Efficient: $25 \times 4 = 100$, then $100 \times 17 = 1700$
(Instead of $25 \times 17 = 425$, then $425 \times 4 = 1700$)

## Variation 5: Distributive Property
Calculate using the distributive law:

$${{a}} \times ({{b}} + {{c}}) = \, ?$$

Show both methods:
a) Calculate bracket first
b) Use distributive property: $a \times b + a \times c$

**Example:** $7 \times (20 + 3)$
Method a: $7 \times 23 = 161$
Method b: $7 \times 20 + 7 \times 3 = 140 + 21 = 161$

## Variation 6: Nested Brackets
Calculate step by step:

$$(({{a}} + {{b}}) \times {{c}}) - {{d}} = \, ?$$

**Remember:** Work from the inside out!

**Example:** $((15 + 5) \times 3) - 12$
Step 1: $15 + 5 = 20$ (innermost bracket)
Step 2: $20 \times 3 = 60$ (outer bracket)
Step 3: $60 - 12 = 48$

## Variation 7: Mixed Operations with All Four Basic Operations
Calculate:

$${{a}} + {{b}} \times {{c}} - {{d}} : {{e}} = \, ?$$

**Order:** Multiplication and division first (left to right), then addition and subtraction (left to right)

**Example:** $50 + 8 \times 5 - 36 : 4$
Step 1: $8 \times 5 = 40$
Step 2: $36 : 4 = 9$
Step 3: $50 + 40 - 9 = 81$

## Variation 8: Finding Efficient Calculation Paths
Calculate efficiently and explain your strategy:

$${{a}} \times {{b}} + {{a}} \times {{c}} = \, ?$$

**Hint:** Can you factor out a common factor?

**Example:** $12 \times 8 + 12 \times 7$
Efficient: $12 \times (8 + 7) = 12 \times 15 = 180$
(Instead of $96 + 84 = 180$)

## Variation 9: Word Problem Requiring Multiple Operations
A school orders ${{num_books}}$ textbooks at €${{price_book}}$ each and ${{num_workbooks}}$ workbooks at €${{price_workbook}}$ each. They pay with €${{payment}}$.
a) Set up a term for the total cost.
b) Calculate the total cost.
c) How much change do they receive?

**Example:** 25 textbooks at €18 each, 30 workbooks at €12 each, pay with €1000
a) Term: $25 \times 18 + 30 \times 12$
b) Total: $450 + 360 = 810$ euros
c) Change: $1000 - 810 = 190$ euros

## Variation 10: Comparing Different Calculation Strategies
Calculate the following term in two different ways and verify both give the same result:

$${{a}} \times {{b}} - {{a}} \times {{c}} = \, ?$$

**Method 1:** Calculate each multiplication first
**Method 2:** Use the distributive property backwards (factor out)

**Example:** $15 \times 12 - 15 \times 7$
Method 1: $180 - 105 = 75$
Method 2: $15 \times (12 - 7) = 15 \times 5 = 75$ ✓
