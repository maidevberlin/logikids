# Angle Calculations

Create tasks where {{child_name}} calculates missing angles using angle relationships and properties appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Angles on a Straight Line**: Two or more angles on a straight line sum to $180°$. "Angles on a line are ${{65}}°$ and $x$. Find $x$." Or with three angles: "${{40}}°$, ${{75}}°$, and $x$ form a straight line. Find $x$." Vary the given angle measures.

2. **Vertically Opposite Angles**: When two lines intersect, opposite angles are equal. "Two lines intersect. One angle is ${{52}}°$. Find the vertically opposite angle." Include diagrams showing which angle to find.

3. **Angles Around a Point**: Angles around a point sum to $360°$. "Three angles around a point are ${{80}}°$, ${{110}}°$, and $x$. Find $x$." Or with four angles. Vary the number and values of given angles.

4. **Parallel Lines and Transversals**: Corresponding angles are equal, alternate angles are equal. "Two parallel lines are cut by a transversal. If one angle is ${{73}}°$, find the {{corresponding/alternate}} angle." Use SVG diagrams showing the parallel lines and transversal clearly.

5. **Triangle Angle Sum**: Angles in a triangle sum to $180°$. "In triangle ABC, angle A = ${{48}}°$ and angle B = ${{67}}°$. Find angle C." Vary with different combinations, include both acute and obtuse triangles (ensure sum = $180°$).

6. **Quadrilateral Angle Sum**: Angles in a quadrilateral sum to $360°$. "A quadrilateral has angles ${{85}}°$, ${{95}}°$, ${{110}}°$, and $x$. Find $x$." Include special quadrilaterals where some angles are equal.

7. **Polygon Angle Sums**: Sum of interior angles = $(n-2) \times 180°$. "What is the sum of interior angles in a {{pentagon/hexagon/octagon}}?" Then: "A regular {{hexagon}} has interior angle sum ${{720}}°$. What is each angle?" Vary the polygon ({{5-8}} sides).

8. **Multi-Step Angle Problems**: Combine multiple angle relationships. Use parallel lines with transversals and triangles, or complex figures requiring several steps. "Two parallel lines are cut by a transversal forming a triangle. Given angles are ${{50}}°$ and ${{65}}°$. Find the missing angle in the triangle."

Use clear SVG diagrams showing angle positions. Label known angles with their measures and unknown angles with letters ($x$, $y$, $z$). Include both calculation tasks and reasoning questions ("Explain why these angles must be equal"). Present formulas clearly:
- Straight line: $a + b = 180°$
- Around point: sum $= 360°$
- Triangle: $a + b + c = 180°$
- Polygon: $(n-2) \times 180°$

Vary angle measures to ensure varied answers (avoid always using multiples of 10). Include contexts like roof angles, navigation bearings, structural supports.
