# Relative Frequency

Create diverse problems involving absolute and relative frequency, converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages, and representing data in diagrams.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Basic Relative Frequency - Class Survey
In a class of {{total_students}} students, {{count}} students {{characteristic}}.

a) What is the absolute frequency of students who {{characteristic}}?
b) Calculate the relative frequency as a fraction (simplify if possible)
c) Express the relative frequency as a decimal (round to 2 decimal places)
d) Express the relative frequency as a percentage

**Formula:**
$$\text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Absolute Frequency}}{\text{Total Number}}$$

**Show all three representations:**
| Representation | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Fraction | |
| Decimal | |
| Percentage | |

### 2. Dice Rolling Experiment
A die is rolled {{total_rolls}} times. The results are:

| Number | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| 1 | {{freq1}} |
| 2 | {{freq2}} |
| 3 | {{freq3}} |
| 4 | {{freq4}} |
| 5 | {{freq5}} |
| 6 | {{freq6}} |

a) What is the relative frequency of rolling a {{target_number}}?
b) What is the relative frequency of rolling an even number?
c) What is the relative frequency of rolling a number greater than {{threshold}}?
d) Express each answer as a fraction, decimal, and percentage

**Verify:** All relative frequencies should sum to 1 (or 100%).

### 3. Weather Data Analysis
Weather records for {{days}} days in {{month}}:

- Sunny: {{sunny}} days
- Rainy: {{rainy}} days
- Cloudy: {{cloudy}} days
- Snowy: {{snowy}} days

a) Calculate the relative frequency for each weather type
b) Create a table showing absolute frequency, relative frequency (as fraction and percentage)
c) Which weather type was most common?
d) If this pattern continues, what is the probability of a sunny day next month?

**Complete table:**
| Weather | Absolute Frequency | Relative Frequency (Fraction) | Relative Frequency (%) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Sunny | | | |
| Rainy | | | |
| Cloudy | | | |
| Snowy | | | |
| **Total** | {{days}} | 1 | 100% |

### 4. Sports Statistics
A basketball player attempted {{total_shots}} shots during a game:
- Made: {{made}} shots
- Missed: {{missed}} shots

a) Calculate the relative frequency of made shots (shooting percentage)
b) Express as a fraction, decimal (3 decimal places), and percentage
c) If the player attempts {{future_shots}} shots in the next game with the same success rate, how many shots would you expect them to make?

**Shooting percentage formula:**
$$\text{Shooting \%} = \frac{\text{Made Shots}}{\text{Total Attempts}} \times 100\%$$

### 5. Comparison of Relative Frequencies
Survey results from two different classes:

**Class A** ({{students_a}} students):
- Prefer pizza: {{pizza_a}} students
- Prefer burgers: {{burger_a}} students
- Prefer salad: {{salad_a}} students

**Class B** ({{students_b}} students):
- Prefer pizza: {{pizza_b}} students
- Prefer burgers: {{burger_b}} students
- Prefer salad: {{salad_b}} students

a) Calculate the relative frequency of students who prefer pizza in each class
b) Which class has a higher relative frequency for pizza preference?
c) Can you compare absolute frequencies directly? Why or why not?
d) Create a comparison table with relative frequencies (as percentages)

### 6. Creating a Bar Chart
Based on the data: {{total}} students chose their favorite subject:

| Subject | Number of Students |
|---------|-------------------|
| Math | {{math_students}} |
| Science | {{science_students}} |
| English | {{english_students}} |
| Art | {{art_students}} |

a) Calculate the relative frequency for each subject (as percentage)
b) Create a bar chart showing the relative frequencies
c) Which subject is most popular? What is its relative frequency?
d) If you survey {{new_total}} students, how many would you expect to choose Math based on this data?

**Note:** Draw bars proportional to the percentages.

### 7. Coin Flipping Experiment
A coin is flipped {{total_flips}} times:
- Heads: {{heads}} times
- Tails: {{tails}} times

a) Calculate the relative frequency of heads
b) Calculate the relative frequency of tails
c) Express both as decimals rounded to 3 decimal places
d) Is the coin fair? Explain based on the relative frequencies (theoretical probability for a fair coin is 0.5 for each)
e) What is the difference between the experimental relative frequency and theoretical probability?

### 8. Traffic Survey - Multiple Categories
A traffic survey counted {{total_vehicles}} vehicles:

- Cars: {{cars}}
- Trucks: {{trucks}}
- Motorcycles: {{motorcycles}}
- Buses: {{buses}}

a) Complete a frequency table with absolute and relative frequencies
b) Express relative frequencies as fractions (simplified), decimals (2 places), and percentages
c) What fraction of vehicles were NOT cars?
d) If {{future_count}} vehicles pass tomorrow, estimate how many will be buses

**Comprehensive table:**
| Vehicle Type | Absolute Frequency | Fraction | Decimal | Percentage |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|---------|------------|
| Cars | | | | |
| Trucks | | | | |
| Motorcycles | | | | |
| Buses | | | | |

### 9. Comparing Experimental and Theoretical Probability
A bag contains {{red}} red marbles, {{blue}} blue marbles, and {{green}} green marbles.

In an experiment, you draw a marble {{draws}} times (with replacement):
- Red drawn: {{red_drawn}} times
- Blue drawn: {{blue_drawn}} times
- Green drawn: {{green_drawn}} times

a) Calculate the theoretical probability (relative frequency in the bag) for each color
b) Calculate the experimental relative frequency for each color
c) Compare theoretical and experimental values in a table
d) Which color shows the biggest difference between theoretical and experimental?

**Comparison table:**
| Color | Theoretical Probability | Experimental Relative Frequency | Difference |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| Red | | | |
| Blue | | | |
| Green | | | |

### 10. Multi-Step Analysis - School Cafeteria
The school cafeteria served {{total_meals}} meals over {{num_days}} days:

| Day | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
|-----|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Meals | {{mon}} | {{tue}} | {{wed}} | {{thu}} | {{fri}} |

a) Calculate the relative frequency for each day (as fraction and percentage)
b) On which day was the relative frequency highest?
c) What is the mean (average) number of meals per day?
d) On which days was the number of meals above average?
e) If the cafeteria serves meals for {{future_days}} days following the same pattern, estimate total meals served

## Task Requirements
- Include conversions between fractions, decimals, and percentages
- Provide at least 2 real-world contexts (surveys, sports, weather, traffic, etc.)
- Emphasize the formula: Relative Frequency = Absolute Frequency ÷ Total
- Use tables to organize data clearly
- Include questions comparing theoretical probability vs. experimental relative frequency
- Show rounding conventions (typically 2-3 decimal places)
- Verify that all relative frequencies sum to 1 (or 100%)
- Use varied total counts and frequencies across different task generations
- Include at least one visualization request (bar chart, pie chart concept)
