# Addition and Subtraction up to 100 Tasks

Create problems that help students master mental arithmetic strategies and develop fluency with two-digit addition and subtraction.

**Vary the problem structure:**

1. **Basic Addition Without Crossing Tens:**
   - Simple addition: "${{tens1}}{{ones1}} + {{tens2}}{{ones2}} = \text{?}$"
   - Word problems: "{{name}} has ${{num1}}$ stickers and gets ${{num2}}$ more. How many now?"
   - Missing addend: "${{num}} + \text{?} = {{sum}}$"

2. **Addition With Crossing Tens:**
   - Bridging through ten: "${{num1}} + {{num2}} = \text{?}$ (e.g., $37 + 8$)"
   - Decompose and add: "To solve ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$, first add to the next ten"
   - Multiple steps: "${{start}} + {{add1}} + {{add2}} = \text{?}$"

3. **Basic Subtraction Without Crossing Tens:**
   - Simple subtraction: "${{num1}} - {{num2}} = \text{?}$"
   - Word problems: "There were ${{total}}$ birds, ${{flew}}$ flew away. How many remain?"
   - Finding the difference: "What is the difference between ${{num1}}$ and ${{num2}}$?"

4. **Subtraction With Crossing Tens:**
   - Bridging through ten: "${{num1}} - {{num2}} = \text{?}$ (e.g., $52 - 7$)"
   - Decompose to subtract: "To solve ${{minuend}} - {{subtrahend}}$, subtract to the previous ten first"
   - Multi-step: "${{start}} - {{sub1}} - {{sub2}} = \text{?}$"

5. **Complement to 100:**
   - Make 100: "${{num}} + \text{?} = 100$"
   - Subtraction from 100: "$100 - {{num}} = \text{?}$"
   - Word problems: "{{name}} needs $100$ points. They have ${{current}}$ points. How many more needed?"

6. **Inverse Operations:**
   - Fact families: "If ${{a}} + {{b}} = {{sum}}$, then ${{sum}} - {{a}} = \text{?}$"
   - Check your work: "Solve ${{num1}} - {{num2}}$ and check using addition"
   - Missing number: "${{num1}} - \text{?} = {{result}}$"

7. **Calculation Strategies:**
   - Jump strategy on number line: "Start at ${{start}}$, jump by $+{{jump1}}$, then $+{{jump2}}$"
   - Splitting strategy: "Solve ${{num1}} + {{num2}}$ by splitting into tens and ones"
   - Compensation: "${{num1}} + {{num2}}$ - try adding ${{round}}$ first, then adjust"

8. **Mixed Operations and Word Problems:**
   - Three numbers: "${{num1}} + {{num2}} - {{num3}} = \text{?}$"
   - Real-world story: "{{name}} had ${{start}}$ marbles, won ${{won}}$ more, then lost ${{lost}}$. How many now?"
   - Comparison problems: "{{person1}} has ${{amount1}}$, {{person2}} has ${{amount2}}$. How many more does {{person1}} have?"

**Use these calculation strategies in prompts:**
- Completing to tens (e.g., $27 + 8 = 27 + 3 + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35$)
- Decomposing numbers ($45 + 32 = 40 + 30 + 5 + 2$)
- Using friendly numbers (compensation)
- Number line jumps
- Inverse operations for checking
