name: Integer Operations
description: Adding and subtracting integers using number line models and sign rules, understanding absolute value in calculations, and applying integer operations to real-world contexts
grade: 6
focus: Operations with positive and negative integers
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Add integers using number line movements and sign rules
  - Subtract integers by adding the opposite (additive inverse)
  - Apply sign rules systematically for addition and subtraction
  - Use absolute value to determine distance and magnitude in calculations
  - Solve multi-step problems involving integer addition and subtraction
  - Connect integer operations to real-world contexts like temperature changes and financial transactions
problem_types:
  - Integer addition
  - Integer subtraction
  - Adding opposites
  - Absolute value application
  - Number line operations
  - Sign rule application
  - Multi-step integer calculations
  - Real-world integer problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Addition of two integers with values from -20 to 20
    - Subtraction where the result stays within -20 to 20
    - Clear sign patterns (positive + positive, negative + negative)
  medium:
    - Mixed sign operations requiring careful sign rule application
    - Three or more integers in a single expression
    - Problems involving absolute value comparisons
  hard:
    - Complex expressions with multiple operations and grouping
    - Problems requiring strategic use of properties (commutative, associative)
    - Multi-step real-world scenarios with temperature or financial contexts
prerequisites:
  - grade5-negative-numbers
  - grade5-arithmetic-operations
real_world_context:
  - Temperature changes throughout the day or across seasons (rising and falling degrees)
  - Bank account transactions with deposits (positive) and withdrawals (negative)
  - Elevator movements going up and down floors including basement levels
  - Game scores with points gained and lost during play
  - Altitude changes when hiking up mountains and down into valleys
  - Football yardage tracking gains and losses on plays
  - Stock market tracking daily rises and falls in value
  - Scuba diving recording depths below sea level
  - Time zone calculations crossing international date lines
  - Golf scoring relative to par with birdies and bogeys
  - Budget tracking with income and expenses over time
  - Chemistry experiments measuring temperature changes in reactions
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid multiplication or division of integers (separate concept)
  - Don't use integers with absolute values larger than 100
  - Avoid mixing integer operations with fractions or decimals
  - Don't introduce algebraic variables
  - Avoid expressions requiring order of operations beyond addition/subtraction
