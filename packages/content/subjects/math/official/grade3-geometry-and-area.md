age_guidelines:
  8:
    - Use clear, simple figures with obvious properties
    - Focus on basic symmetry (one or two lines)
    - Provide grid backgrounds for all area tasks
    - Use whole centimeter measurements only
    - Give visual examples alongside verbal descriptions
    - Keep area measurements under twenty square units
    - Use familiar, concrete real-world contexts
  9:
    - Include more complex composite figures
    - Explore multiple symmetry lines and rotational symmetry
    - Mix gridded and non-gridded area challenges
    - Introduce half-centimeter precision in drawings
    - Rely more on verbal descriptions without visual cues
    - Extend to areas up to fifty square units or more
    - Include less familiar or more abstract contexts

  medium:
    - Describe multiple properties of various figures
    - Find all lines of symmetry in figures with multiple symmetry lines

    - Identify right angles in rotated or oriented figures
    - Compare areas of three or more figures with similar sizes
    - Create own figure with specified property requirements
  hard:
    - Classify unusual or rotated figures by their properties
    - Determine rotational symmetry or prove no symmetry exists
    - Calculate area of composite figures (combinations of shapes)
    - Construct complex figures using compass and ruler with precision
    - Find and justify all right angles in architectural drawings or floor plans
    - Design original figure meeting multiple area and symmetry constraints
    - Solve problems combining several geometric concepts
