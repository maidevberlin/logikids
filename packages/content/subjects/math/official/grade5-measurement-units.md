grade: 5
ages:
  - 10
  - 11
focus: Measurement systems and unit conversions
difficulty: easy
version: 1
version_notes: Migrated to frontmatter-based format, extracted problem types and guidelines from prose content
learning_objectives:
  - Know and apply standard units for lengths (km, m, cm, mm), mass (t, kg, g), time (seconds to years), and money (currency units)
  - Convert fluently between units within the same measurement domain
  - Select appropriate units for measuring specific quantities in context
  - Estimate measurements using reference points and everyday objects
  - Solve multi-step practical problems involving measurements and conversions
prerequisites:
  - grade1-introduction-to-measurement
  - grade2-measurement-skills
  - grade3-all-measurement-domains
real_world_context: Daily activities requiring measurement such as cooking, shopping, sports, health monitoring, construction, and travel planning where selecting correct units and converting between them is essential
problem_types:
  - single-unit conversion
  - multi-step chains
  - unit selection
  - estimation tasks
  - tool matching
  - reverse calculations
  - comparison ordering
  - practical problems
  - conversion arithmetic
  - reasonableness checks
age_guidelines:
  10:
    - Focus on adjacent unit conversions (m to cm, kg to g)
    - Emphasize concrete, familiar contexts from daily life
    - Use mostly whole numbers with simple conversions
    - Single-step conversions and problems
    - Visual or conceptual support for estimation
    - Everyday situations like schoolwork, meals, play
  11:
    - Include conversions across multiple unit boundaries
    - Begin introducing decimal representations
    - Multi-step problems combining conversion with calculation
    - More abstract measurement contexts
    - Estimation requiring deeper understanding of unit relationships
    - Contexts like shopping, sports, travel, health monitoring
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Direct conversion between two adjacent units
    - Whole number results from conversions
    - Clear contextual support for understanding
    - One measurement domain per problem
    - Common, familiar measurements
    - Straightforward conversions without additional operations
  medium:
    - Conversions across multiple unit steps
    - Mix of whole numbers and simple decimals
    - Combine two measurement domains in single problem
    - Multi-step problems that first convert then calculate
    - Moderate estimation challenges requiring reference points
    - Some unfamiliar but plausible contexts
  hard:
    - Complex conversions across entire range of units
    - All four measurement domains potentially integrated
    - Decimal and fractional representations in conversions
    - Reverse calculations finding original measurements
    - Multi-step problems requiring proportional reasoning
    - Abstract scenarios requiring deep unit understanding
