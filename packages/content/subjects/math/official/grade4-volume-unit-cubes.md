name: Volume with Unit Cubes
description: Understanding volume by counting unit cubes and comparing volumes of 3D shapes
grade: 4
focus: Measurement and spatial reasoning
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand volume as the amount of space inside a 3D shape
  - Count unit cubes to determine volume of rectangular prisms
  - Compare volumes of different 3D shapes by counting unit cubes
  - Build shapes with a given volume using unit cubes
  - Recognize that shapes can have the same volume but different appearances
problem_types:
  - Direct cube counting
  - Counting by layers
  - Counting by rows
  - Volume comparison
  - Building from volume
  - Finding missing cubes
  - L-shaped structures
  - Stepped structures
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple rectangular arrangements with all cubes visible
    - Direct counting up to 24 unit cubes
    - Dimensions no larger than 3×4×2
  medium:
    - Larger rectangular prisms requiring layer-by-layer counting
    - Volumes up to 60 unit cubes with some hidden cubes
    - Dimensions up to 5×4×3
  hard:
    - Complex shapes like L-shaped or stepped structures
    - Volumes up to 100 unit cubes with many hidden cubes
    - Problems involving missing cubes or volume comparisons
real_world_context:
  - Packing boxes and containers to determine how many items fit inside
  - Comparing storage capacity of different boxes or drawers
  - Building with construction blocks like LEGO and determining how many blocks you need
  - Filling aquariums or containers and understanding how much space they hold
  - A moving company estimating how many boxes fit in a truck
  - Comparing ice cube tray sizes for party planning
  - Stacking storage bins efficiently in a closet
  - A game designer creating 3D puzzle levels with blocks
  - Calculating soil needed to fill rectangular planter boxes
  - Comparing shipping box sizes for mailing packages
  - Building block towers and counting total cubes used
  - Organizing toy blocks in storage containers
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using volume formulas or algebraic notation
  - Don't use non-integer dimensions or fractional cubes
  - Avoid shapes with more than 100 unit cubes total
  - Don't mix volume with area or perimeter concepts
  - Avoid contexts unfamiliar to 9-10 year olds
prerequisites:
  - grade3-advanced-geometry
  - grade4-geometry-spatial
version: 2
version_notes: Expanded real_world_context from 4 to 12 items for better variety
