# Terms and Variables Tasks

Create mathematics problems that explore algebraic notation, variable manipulation, and term simplification. Problems should help students understand variables as abstract representations, practice combining like terms, apply the distributive law, and transition from arithmetic to algebraic thinking.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Like terms simplification**: Given expressions like $3x + 5x - 2x$ or $7a + 3b - 4a + 2b$, ask students to combine like terms by identifying and grouping terms with the same variable
- **Distributive law (multiplying out brackets)**: Present expressions like $4(2x + 3)$ or $-2(5a - 3b)$ and ask students to apply the distributive property to eliminate brackets
- **Factoring expressions**: Give terms like $6x + 9$ or $15a - 10b$ and ask students to factor out the greatest common factor
- **Mixed operations**: Combine simplification, multiplying out, and factoring in multi-step problems like "Simplify $3(x + 2) + 2(x - 1)$"
- **Substitution and evaluation**: Provide algebraic terms and ask students to evaluate them for specific variable values, e.g., "If $x = 4$, calculate $3x + 5$"
- **Creating expressions**: Give word problems and ask students to write algebraic expressions, e.g., "A ticket costs €x and a drink costs €3. Write an expression for buying 4 tickets and 2 drinks"
- **Comparing expressions**: Present two expressions and ask if they are equivalent, requiring simplification to verify
- **Error analysis**: Show incorrect simplifications and ask students to identify and correct the mistake

**Vary the content/context:**
- **Geometric formulas**: Perimeter expressions like $2a + 2b$ for rectangles, area formulas with variables
- **Money and pricing**: Total cost expressions like $3x + 5y$ where $x$ is item price and $y$ is another item price
- **Science formulas**: Simple physics formulas like $v = d \cdot t$, chemistry mixture problems
- **Abstract expressions**: Pure algebraic terms without context to develop symbolic manipulation skills
- **Coding and programming**: Variable expressions similar to those in programming
- **Pattern recognition**: Sequences defined by algebraic terms

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 13): Focus on simple like terms with small coefficients, single-variable expressions, basic distributive law with positive numbers only, concrete contexts (money, lengths)
- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 13-14): Include negative coefficients, multiple variables (2-3), two-step simplifications, both multiplying out and factoring, mixed operations
- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 15): Complex multi-variable expressions, nested brackets, multiple-step simplifications, abstract reasoning, preparation for equation solving

**Use appropriate formats:**

**LaTeX for formulas:**
- Inline for simple terms: Simplify $3x + 5x$, evaluate $2a - 3b$ for $a = 4, b = 2$
- Block for complex expressions:

$$3(2x + 5) - 2(x - 3)$$

$$4a + 3b - 2(a - b) + 5a$$

**Tables for evaluation:**

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| x        | 3     |
| y        | 5     |

Evaluate: $2x + 3y$

**Adjust difficulty with {{difficulty}}:**
- **Easy**: Single-variable expressions, positive coefficients only, one-step simplifications (combine like terms OR multiply out), direct substitution with small positive integers
- **Medium**: Two variables, negative coefficients included, two-step problems (multiply out AND simplify), factoring simple expressions, substitution with negative numbers
- **Hard**: Three or more variables, nested brackets, multi-step simplifications requiring strategic choices, complex factoring, fractional or decimal coefficients, abstract reasoning without context

**Include variety in numerical values:**
- Different coefficients: 2, 3, 5, 7, -4, -2, 0.5 (for older students)
- Various variable combinations: x, y, a, b, n, m
- Different evaluation values: 0, 1, 2, 5, -3, 10, 0.5
- Multiple terms: 2-term, 3-term, 5-term expressions
- Ensure different numerical answers to prevent memorization
