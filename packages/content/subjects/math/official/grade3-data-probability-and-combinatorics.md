name: Data, Probability and Combinatorics
description: Collect data, create diagrams, investigate probability through experiments, and find all combinations systematically
grade: 3
ages:
  - 8
  - 9
focus: Data handling, probability concepts, and systematic counting
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Design surveys and create various diagram types (bar charts, tables)
  - Distinguish fair from unfair probability situations
  - Conduct systematic probability experiments and compare results
  - Find all combinations using organized methods (tree diagrams, tables)
  - Extract information from data representations and formulate questions
prerequisites:
  - grade2-representing-data
  - grade2-probabilities
real_world_context: Students work with data from their immediate environment (class surveys, weather data, favorite activities), probability games (spinners, dice), and everyday combination problems (outfit choices, menu planning)
problem_types:
  - Survey design
  - Data interpretation
  - Probability experiments
  - Fair/unfair games
  - Finding combinations
  - Systematic enumeration
  - Experiment variations
  - Multi-step data
