# Data, Probability and Combinatorics

Generate tasks that help students collect and organize data, explore probability through hands-on experiments, and discover all possible combinations through systematic approaches.

## Task Generator Instructions

Create tasks that engage students with data collection, probability exploration, and combinatorial thinking appropriate for {{age}}-year-old learners at {{difficulty}} level.

### Problem Structure Variations

Design tasks using these different approaches (select based on context and learning focus):

**Survey and Data Collection Tasks**
Students plan surveys about topics from their world, decide what questions to ask, collect responses, and organize findings in tables or diagrams. Focus on meaningful questions that produce interesting data patterns.

**Data Interpretation Tasks**
Present tables, bar charts, or pictographs containing information about familiar scenarios. Students extract specific facts, compare categories, identify patterns, and formulate their own questions about the data shown.

**Probability Experiment Design**
Students investigate random experiments with spinners, dice, drawing objects from containers, or coin flips. They estimate outcomes before testing, conduct multiple trials, record results, and compare predictions with actual frequencies.

**Fair vs Unfair Game Analysis**
Present game scenarios with different probability setups. Students analyze whether all players have equal chances, explain why games are fair or unfair, and suggest modifications to make unfair games fair.

**Combination Finding Tasks**
Students determine all possible combinations when choosing from sets of objects (clothing items, food choices, color combinations, activity pairings). Emphasize systematic enumeration to ensure no possibilities are missed.

**Systematic Enumeration with Constraints**
Students find all arrangements or selections that meet specific criteria. Include scenarios like forming number combinations, creating sequences with rules, or pairing items with restrictions.

**Experiment Variation Analysis**
Students modify parameters in probability experiments (change number of objects, alter colors/numbers, adjust spinner sections) and predict how changes affect outcomes. Compare results across different experiment configurations.

**Multi-Step Data Problems**
Combine data representation with calculation. Students derive non-obvious information from schedules or tables (calculate duration between events, find totals across categories, determine differences).

### Age-Based Complexity Scaffolding

**For {{age}} < 9:**
Use concrete, familiar contexts from immediate experience. Surveys about class favorites, simple two-category comparisons, basic spinner experiments with clear visual representations. Combinations with 2-3 item sets. Qualitative probability language (more likely, less likely, equally likely).

**For {{age}} >= 9:**
Introduce multi-category surveys, more complex data displays requiring calculation to extract information. Probability experiments with multiple variables. Combination problems with 3-4 item sets. Begin quantitative probability discussion (counting favorable outcomes).

### Difficulty Level Differentiation

**{{difficulty}} = easy:**
Simple data collection with 2-3 categories, direct reading from clearly labeled diagrams, probability experiments with obvious unequal outcomes (spinner with very different section sizes), combination problems with small sets (2-3 items from 2-3 categories), structured templates provided for organization.

**{{difficulty}} = medium:**
Multi-category surveys requiring data organization decisions, interpreting diagrams with scales or multiple data sets, probability experiments with subtle differences in outcomes, combination problems with larger sets (3-4 items from 3 categories), students choose their own organization method.

**{{difficulty}} = hard:**
Complex data requiring decisions about appropriate representation type, creating own diagrams from raw data, probability experiments requiring systematic modification and comparison, combination problems with constraints or exclusions, finding patterns in combinatorial situations, explaining reasoning mathematically.

### Numerical Value Variation Principles

**Survey Data:**
Vary number of categories (2-6 categories), number of responses (small class of 12-15, larger group of 20-30), magnitude of differences between categories (very clear winner vs close competition). Use diverse topics ensuring variety across tasks.

**Probability Experiments:**
Vary number of trials (range from 5-10 quick trials to 20-50 repeated experiments), number of outcomes (2-6 different possibilities), distribution of favorable outcomes (from very unlikely to very likely). Rotate experiment types (spinners, dice, draws, coins).

**Combinatorial Sets:**
Vary number of categories (2-4 categories), number of items per category (2-5 items each), total number of combinations (range from 4 to 40+ possibilities depending on difficulty). Use diverse contexts avoiding repetition.

**Diagram Scales:**
Use different scales and ranges (by 1s for small datasets, by 2s or 5s for larger values, maximum values ranging from 10 to 100+). Vary axis labels and grid configurations.

### Representation Format Guidance

**When to use tables:**
Raw data organization, showing multiple attributes simultaneously, comparison across categories with specific values, frequency counts from experiments, systematic enumeration of combinations.

**When to use diagrams:**
Visual comparison of quantities (bar charts for categorical data), showing data patterns at a glance, making differences in magnitude immediately visible, pictographs for younger students or when objects have natural representations.

**When to use tree diagrams:**
Systematic enumeration of all possibilities in combination problems, showing branching choices clearly, ensuring no combinations are forgotten, visualizing multi-step selection processes.

**When to use lists:**
Simple enumeration when organization structure is obvious, recording experiment outcomes in sequence, brainstorming all possibilities before organizing systematically.

### Context Variety

Note: Specific contexts (seasonal, cultural, character-based) are handled by the backend variation system. Focus on the mathematical structure while allowing context to be applied flexibly.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Do not:**
- Create surveys about trivial topics that produce meaningless data
- Present diagrams with ambiguous scales or unlabeled axes
- Design probability experiments where outcomes are completely unpredictable without pattern
- Give combination problems where systematic approach is impossible
- Use overly complex probability language inappropriate for age level
- Present data that requires calculation beyond grade level to interpret
- Create combination scenarios with so many possibilities that enumeration becomes tedious rather than systematic

**Do:**
- Choose survey topics generating interesting, varied responses
- Ensure all data displays have clear labels, appropriate scales, and accurate representations
- Design probability experiments where systematic investigation reveals meaningful patterns
- Structure combination problems so systematic methods clearly help find all possibilities
- Use age-appropriate probability language (likely/unlikely rather than formal fractions)
- Include data requiring some thought to interpret but within calculation abilities
- Balance combination problem size to be challenging but completable with systematic approach

### Integration of Process Skills

Encourage students to:
- **Reason** about which data representation format best communicates information
- **Explain** why certain probability outcomes happen more frequently than others
- **Justify** that all combinations have been found by showing systematic method
- **Compare** experimental probability results with predictions and explain differences
- **Communicate** findings from data analysis using mathematical language
- **Model** real-world situations with surveys, probability experiments, or combination scenarios
