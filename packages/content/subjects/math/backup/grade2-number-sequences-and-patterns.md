# Number Sequences and Patterns Tasks

Create problems that help students identify, analyze, and create number patterns in sequences and on the hundred square.

**Vary the problem structure:**

1. **Skip Counting Sequences:**
   - Count by 2s: "${{start}}, {{next}}, {{after}}, \ldots$ Continue counting by $2$s"
   - Count by 5s: "Start at ${{start}}$ and count by $5$s. What are the next four numbers?"
   - Count by 10s: "$10, 20, 30, \ldots$ What is the ${{nth}}$ number?"
   - Mixed sequences: "Is this counting by 2s, 5s, or 10s? ${{seq}}$"

2. **Growing and Shrinking Patterns:**
   - Add pattern: "${{start}}, {{val1}}, {{val2}}, {{val3}}, \ldots$ (add ${{step}}$ each time)"
   - Subtract pattern: "${{start}}, {{val1}}, {{val2}}, \ldots$ What comes next?"
   - Find the rule: "What rule makes this pattern? ${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}$"
   - Continue both ways: "Continue this pattern forward and backward: $\ldots, {{before}}, {{num}}, {{after}}, \ldots$"

3. **Patterns on the Hundred Square:**
   - Row patterns: "Look at a row in the hundred square. What pattern do you see?"
   - Column patterns: "What happens when you go down a column?"
   - Diagonal patterns: "What do you notice about diagonal numbers?"
   - Color patterns: "Color all multiples of ${{num}}$ on the hundred square. What pattern appears?"

**Hundred Square Reference:**
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |
| 21 | 22 | 23 | ... | | | | | | 30 |
| ... | | | | | | | | | |
| 91 | 92 | 93 | ... | | | | | | 100 |

4. **Missing Numbers in Sequences:**
   - Single gap: "${{num1}}, {{num2}}, \text{?}, {{num4}}, {{num5}}$"
   - Multiple gaps: "${{start}}, \text{?}, \text{?}, {{num}}, \text{?}$"
   - Find the error: "Which number doesn't fit? ${{n1}}, {{n2}}, {{wrong}}, {{n4}}, {{n5}}$"

5. **Even and Odd Patterns:**
   - Identify even/odd: "Circle the even numbers: ${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}$"
   - Even sequence: "Continue the even number pattern: $2, 4, 6, \ldots$"
   - Odd sequence: "What are the next three odd numbers after ${{start}}$?"
   - Pattern observation: "What pattern do you see in the ones digit of even numbers?"

6. **Number Patterns with Operations:**
   - Add then subtract: "${{start}}, +{{add}}, -{{sub}}, +{{add}}, -{{sub}}, \ldots$"
   - Doubling: "${{start}}, {{double}}, {{quadruple}}, \ldots$ (doubling each time)"
   - Mixed operations: "What's the pattern? ${{n1}}, {{n2}}, {{n3}}, {{n4}}$ Hint: Look at what operation connects them"

7. **Creating Own Patterns:**
   - Design a pattern: "Create a number pattern using the rule: start at ${{start}}$, add ${{step}}$ each time"
   - Multiple rules: "Make a pattern that uses two different rules (e.g., add 5, subtract 2, repeat)"
   - Challenge: "Create the longest pattern you can between ${{min}}$ and ${{max}}$ using steps of ${{step}}$"

8. **Real-World Pattern Applications:**
   - Money patterns: "Counting nickels (5 cents each): $5¢, 10¢, 15¢, \ldots$ How much for ${{num}}$ nickels?"
   - Time patterns: "Class starts at ${{time}}$ and meets every ${{interval}}$ minutes. When are the next three class times?"
   - Measurement: "A plant grows ${{cm}}$ cm each week. How tall after ${{weeks}}$ weeks if it starts at ${{start}}$ cm?"
   - Calendar: "If today is the ${{day}}$th, what dates are the next four ${{weekday}}$s?"

**Pattern exploration prompts:**
- "Describe the pattern in your own words"
- "What is the rule that creates this pattern?"
- "How would you continue this pattern?"
- "Can you find a different pattern that starts the same way?"
