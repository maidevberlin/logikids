# Terms with Variables

Generate a problem about algebraic terms appropriate for a {{age}}-year-old student (Grade {{grade}}) at {{difficulty}} difficulty level.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Writing Terms from Word Descriptions
Write an algebraic term for each description:

**Examples:**
- Easy: "Five more than $x$" → $x + 5$
- Easy: "The product of 3 and $n$" → $3n$ or $3 \cdot n$
- Medium: "Seven less than twice $a$" → $2a - 7$
- Medium: "The sum of $x$ and the product of 4 and $y$" → $x + 4y$
- Hard: "Three times the sum of $m$ and 5" → $3(m + 5)$
- Hard: "Half of $x$ decreased by 8" → $\frac{x}{2} - 8$

**Word phrases to translate:**
a) {{phrase1}}
b) {{phrase2}}
c) {{phrase3}}

### 2. Interpreting Terms
Write each term as a word phrase:

**Examples:**
- Easy: $x + 8$ → "Eight more than $x$" or "$x$ plus 8"
- Easy: $5n$ → "Five times $n$" or "The product of 5 and $n$"
- Medium: $3a - 4$ → "Four less than three times $a$"
- Hard: $2(x + 7)$ → "Twice the sum of $x$ and 7"

**Terms to interpret:**
a) ${{term1}}$
b) ${{term2}}$
c) ${{term3}}$

### 3. Evaluating Terms for Given Values
Calculate the value of the term ${{term}}$ when:

**Example terms and values:**
- Easy: $2x + 5$ when $x = 3$ → $2(3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11$
- Easy: $3n - 4$ when $n = 7$ → $3(7) - 4 = 21 - 4 = 17$
- Medium: $4a + 2b$ when $a = 5, b = 3$ → $4(5) + 2(3) = 20 + 6 = 26$
- Medium: $5x - 3y$ when $x = 8, y = 4$ → $5(8) - 3(4) = 40 - 12 = 28$
- Hard: $3(m + 2) - 5$ when $m = 6$ → $3(6 + 2) - 5 = 3(8) - 5 = 24 - 5 = 19$

**Show your work:**
a) ${{variable1}} = {{value1}}$
b) ${{variable2}} = {{value2}}$
c) ${{variable3}} = {{value3}}$

### 4. Evaluating Terms with Two Variables
Given the term ${{term}}$, complete the table:

| ${{var1}}$ | ${{var2}}$ | ${{term}}$ |
|------|------|-------|
| {{val1a}} | {{val1b}} | ? |
| {{val2a}} | {{val2b}} | ? |
| {{val3a}} | {{val3b}} | ? |

**Example terms:**
- Easy: $x + y$ with values (3,5), (7,2), (4,8)
- Medium: $3a + 2b$ with values (4,5), (6,3), (2,7)
- Hard: $5m - 2n$ with values (8,6), (10,12), (7,9)

### 5. Identifying Equivalent Terms
Which of the following terms are equivalent to ${{term}}$?

**Test by substituting values** (e.g., let $x = 2$, $x = 5$, etc.)

**Example groups:**
- Easy: Is $2x + 2x$ equivalent to $4x$?
- Medium: Which are equivalent? $3x + 5x$, $8x$, $5x + 3x$, $x \cdot 8$
- Hard: Is $2(x + 3)$ equivalent to $2x + 6$?

**Options to test:**
a) ${{option1}}$
b) ${{option2}}$
c) ${{option3}}$

### 6. Simplifying Terms by Combining Like Terms
Simplify the following terms:

**Examples:**
- Easy: $3x + 5x = 8x$
- Easy: $7n - 2n = 5n$
- Medium: $4a + 3a + 2 = 7a + 2$
- Medium: $8x - 3x + 5 = 5x + 5$
- Hard: $6m + 4 - 2m + 3 = 4m + 7$
- Hard: $5y + 3x + 2y - x = 7y + 2x$

**Terms to simplify:**
a) ${{term1}}$
b) ${{term2}}$
c) ${{term3}}$

### 7. Real-World Terms Application
**Cost calculation:** A ticket costs ${{base}} plus ${{per_person}} per person.

a) Write a term for the total cost for $n$ people.
b) Calculate the cost for {{num}} people.

**Example values:**
- Easy: Base $5, $3 per person, calculate for 4 people
- Medium: Base $12, $7 per person, calculate for 6 people
- Hard: Base $25, $15 per person, calculate for 8 people

**Answer:**
- Term: ${{base}} + {{per_person}}n$
- For $n = {{num}}$: Total cost = ?

**Savings problem:** You have ${{start}} and save ${{per_week}} each week.

a) Write a term for total money after $w$ weeks.
b) How much will you have after {{weeks}} weeks?

### 8. Pattern Recognition with Terms
Look at this sequence: {{seq1}}, {{seq2}}, {{seq3}}, {{seq4}}, ...

**Questions:**
a) Describe the pattern in words.
b) Write a term for the $n$-th value in the sequence.
c) Use your term to find the {{position}}-th value.

**Example sequences:**
- Easy: 3, 5, 7, 9, ... (Term: $2n + 1$)
- Medium: 5, 8, 11, 14, ... (Term: $3n + 2$)
- Hard: 4, 9, 14, 19, ... (Term: $5n - 1$)

**Table format:**
| Position ($n$) | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| 1 | {{seq1}} |
| 2 | {{seq2}} |
| 3 | {{seq3}} |
| 4 | {{seq4}} |
| {{position}} | ? |

## Solution Requirements
