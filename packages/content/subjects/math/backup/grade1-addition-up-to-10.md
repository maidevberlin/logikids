# Addition up to 10

Generate age-appropriate addition tasks within the number range 0-10. Use concrete examples, visual representations, and varied problem types.

## Task Variations

### 1. Simple Addition Problems
Present straightforward addition problems with varying numbers:

Calculate: ${{num1}} + {{num2}} = ?$

Where ${{num1}}$ and ${{num2}}$ are numbers that sum to 10 or less.

**Example:** Calculate: $3 + 5 = ?$

---

### 2. Number Bonds (Part-Part-Whole)
Show decomposition of numbers using number bonds:

Complete the number bond:

$${{total}} = {{part1}} + \text{?}$$

Where students find the missing part.

**Example:** Complete: $7 = 4 + ?$

---

### 3. Story Problems with Objects
Create relatable word problems:

{{name}} has ${{num1}}$ {{object}}. {{He/She}} gets ${{num2}}$ more. How many {{object}} does {{name}} have now?

**Example:** Tim has 2 marbles. He gets 6 more. How many marbles does Tim have now?

---

### 4. Number Line Addition
Use number line representation:

Use the number line to find: ${{num1}} + {{num2}} = ?$

```
0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---10
```

Start at ${{num1}}$ and jump ${{num2}}$ steps forward.

**Example:** Start at 4 and jump 3 steps forward: $4 + 3 = ?$

---

### 5. Commutative Property
Demonstrate that order doesn't matter:

Fill in the missing number:

$${{num1}} + {{num2}} = {{num2}} + \text{?}$$

**Example:** $3 + 6 = 6 + ?$

---

### 6. Three Addends
Simple problems with three numbers:

Calculate: ${{num1}} + {{num2}} + {{num3}} = ?$

Where the sum is 10 or less.

**Example:** Calculate: $2 + 3 + 4 = ?$

---

### 7. Visual Representation with Dots
Present addition using visual elements:

Count the dots and write the addition:

● ● ● + ● ● ● ● = ?

**Example:** 3 dots + 4 dots = ?

---

### 8. Missing Addend Problems
Find the missing number:

${{num1}} + \text{?} = {{sum}}$

Where students calculate ${{sum}} - {{num1}}$.

**Example:** $5 + ? = 9$
