# Divisibility Problems

Generate a divisibility problem appropriate for a {{age}}-year-old student (Grade {{grade}}) at {{difficulty}} difficulty level.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Finding All Divisors
Find all divisors of {{number}}.

**Example numbers:**
- Easy: 18, 24, 30, 40
- Medium: 48, 56, 72, 84
- Hard: 96, 100, 108, 120

**Table format:**
| Number | Divisors |
|--------|----------|
| {{number}} | ? |

### 2. Applying Divisibility Rules
Which of the following numbers is divisible by {{divisor}}?

**Test numbers:** {{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}, {{num5}}

**Divisibility rules to test:**
- Divisible by 2: Last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8
- Divisible by 3: Sum of digits is divisible by 3
- Divisible by 5: Last digit is 0 or 5
- Divisible by 9: Sum of digits is divisible by 9
- Divisible by 10: Last digit is 0

### 3. Prime Factorization
Write the prime factorization of {{number}}.

**Example numbers:**
- Easy: 12, 18, 20, 30
- Medium: 36, 45, 60, 75
- Hard: 84, 90, 100, 108

**Express as:** ${{number}} = {{prime1}}^{{{exp1}}} \cdot {{prime2}}^{{{exp2}}} \cdots$

### 4. Prime Numbers
Is {{number}} a prime number? Justify your answer.

**Numbers to test:**
- Easy: 17, 21, 23, 27, 29
- Medium: 31, 35, 37, 41, 49
- Hard: 51, 53, 57, 59, 61

If not prime, find all its prime factors.

### 5. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Find the greatest common divisor of {{num1}} and {{num2}}.

**Number pairs:**
- Easy: GCD(12, 18), GCD(15, 25), GCD(20, 30)
- Medium: GCD(24, 36), GCD(28, 42), GCD(30, 45)
- Hard: GCD(48, 72), GCD(54, 81), GCD(60, 90)

**Methods:**
1. List all divisors method
2. Prime factorization method

### 6. Least Common Multiple (LCM)
Find the least common multiple of {{num1}} and {{num2}}.

**Number pairs:**
- Easy: LCM(4, 6), LCM(6, 8), LCM(5, 10)
- Medium: LCM(12, 15), LCM(18, 24), LCM(15, 20)
- Hard: LCM(24, 36), LCM(30, 45), LCM(18, 27)

**Real-world context:** When do two buses arriving every {{num1}} and {{num2}} minutes arrive at the same time again?

### 7. Multiples Identification
List the first {{count}} multiples of {{number}}.

**Example:**
- First 5 multiples of 7: $7, 14, 21, 28, 35$
- First 6 multiples of 12: $12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72$

### 8. GCD and LCM Application Problem
Two ropes measure {{length1}} cm and {{length2}} cm.

**Part A:** What is the longest possible length you can cut both ropes into equal pieces? (GCD)

**Part B:** What is the shortest length of rope that can be made using whole pieces of both ropes? (LCM)

**Example values:**
- Easy: 12 cm and 18 cm
- Medium: 24 cm and 36 cm
- Hard: 45 cm and 60 cm

## Solution Requirements

Provide:
1. **Clear explanation** of the method used
2. **Step-by-step work** showing divisibility tests or factorization
3. **Final answer** clearly stated
4. For GCD/LCM: Show both the listing method and prime factorization method when appropriate
