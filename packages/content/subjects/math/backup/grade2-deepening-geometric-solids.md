# Deepening Geometric Solids

Generate a task where {{name}} explores properties of three-dimensional geometric solids appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Focus on cylinders, pyramids, and cones, building on knowledge of cubes and cuboids.

Use varied approaches:

**Identifying Solids:**
- Present descriptions or images and ask students to name the solid
- Example: "This solid has $2$ circular faces and $1$ curved surface. What is it?"
- Use everyday objects: "A can of soup is shaped like a ______."

**Counting Faces, Edges, and Vertices:**
- Ask students to count and describe the properties of solids
- Example: "A square pyramid has a square base and $4$ triangular faces. How many faces does it have in total? How many vertices?"

| Property | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Faces | ? |
| Edges | ? |
| Vertices | ? |

**Comparing Solids:**
- Compare properties of different solids
- Example: "What is the difference between a cylinder and a cone? Both have circular bases, but..."
- "Which has more vertices: a pyramid with a triangular base or a pyramid with a square base?"

**Real-World Objects:**
- Identify geometric solids in everyday objects
- Example: "Name $3$ objects in your classroom that are shaped like a cylinder."
- Examples: cans, tubes, drums (cylinder); party hats, ice cream cones (cone); tents (pyramid)

**Building Solids:**
- Describe how to construct solids from nets or other materials
- Example: "To build a square pyramid, you need $1$ square and $4$ identical triangles. If the square has sides of $5$ cm, what shape are the $4$ other faces?"

**Faces and Shapes:**
- Identify the 2D shapes that make up 3D solids
- Example: "A cylinder has two ______ (circle/square/triangle) faces and one curved surface."
- "What shapes are the faces of a triangular pyramid?"

**Grouping by Properties:**
- Sort solids by specific properties
- Example: "Which of these solids have at least one curved surface: cube, cylinder, cone, pyramid?"
- "Which solids have only flat faces?"

**Nets and Unfolding:**
- Explore which 2D net can fold into which 3D solid
- Example: "This net has $1$ circle and $1$ sector (pie slice shape). What solid does it make when folded?"

**Volume Concepts (Introductory):**
- Compare relative sizes informally
- Example: "If you fill a cone and a cylinder with the same base and height with water, which holds more?"

Use tables to organize properties. Include simple SVG diagrams when describing solids. Use concrete, familiar objects that 7-8 year olds can visualize and relate to their everyday experience.
