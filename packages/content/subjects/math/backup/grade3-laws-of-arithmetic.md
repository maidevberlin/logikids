# Laws of Arithmetic

Generate tasks that help students discover and apply fundamental properties of arithmetic for efficient mental calculation.

## Task Variations

### 1. Commutative Property of Addition
Order doesn't matter when adding:
- "Is ${{a}} + {{b}}$ the same as ${{b}} + {{a}}$? Check by calculating both."
- Fill-in problems: "$15 + 27 = 27 + ?$"
- "Maya added $8 + 35$ but Tom calculated $35 + 8$. Will they get the same answer? Why?"
- Create matching pairs: Match $12 + 19$ with $19 + 12$
- Example: $7 + 23 = 23 + 7 = 30$

### 2. Commutative Property of Multiplication
Order doesn't matter when multiplying:
- "If $6 \times 8 = 48$, what is $8 \times 6$?"
- Show with arrays: Draw $4 \times 5$ and $5 \times 4$ as dot arrangements
- "Complete: $9 \times 7 = ? \times 9$"
- Word problems: "4 bags with 6 apples each = 6 bags with 4 apples each"
- Tables showing symmetry:

| $\times$ | 3  | 5  | 7  |
|----------|----|----|----|
| **3**    | 9  | 15 | 21 |
| **5**    | 15 | 25 | 35 |
| **7**    | 21 | 35 | 49 |

### 3. Associative Property of Addition
Grouping doesn't matter when adding:
- "Calculate $(5 + 7) + 3$ and $5 + (7 + 3)$. Are they equal?"
- "Which is easier to calculate: $(18 + 27) + 3$ or $18 + (27 + 3)$? Why?"
- Show how regrouping makes mental math easier: $(48 + 26) + 4 = 48 + (26 + 4) = 48 + 30 = 78$
- Practice strategic grouping: $15 + 37 + 5 = (15 + 5) + 37 = 20 + 37 = 57$

### 4. Associative Property of Multiplication
Grouping doesn't matter when multiplying:
- "Is $(2 \times 5) \times 4$ the same as $2 \times (5 \times 4)$?"
- "Which is easier: $(8 \times 5) \times 2$ or $8 \times (5 \times 2)$?"
- Strategic calculation: $4 \times 7 \times 5 = 4 \times 5 \times 7 = 20 \times 7 = 140$
- Show: $(3 \times 2) \times 5 = 6 \times 5 = 30$ and $3 \times (2 \times 5) = 3 \times 10 = 30$

### 5. Distributive Property (Basic)
Break apart multiplication:
- "Calculate $7 \times 12$ by thinking: $7 \times (10 + 2) = 7 \times 10 + 7 \times 2 = 70 + 14 = 84$"
- "Break apart: $6 \times 15 = 6 \times (10 + 5) = ?$"
- Visual rectangles showing area breakdown:

<svg width="300" height="150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Rectangle divided into parts -->
  <rect x="20" y="20" width="200" height="100" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <line x1="150" y1="20" x2="150" y2="120" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" stroke-dasharray="5,5"/>

  <!-- Labels -->
  <text x="80" y="15" font-size="14">10</text>
  <text x="180" y="15" font-size="14">2</text>
  <text x="5" y="75" font-size="14">7</text>

  <text x="70" y="75" font-size="16" fill="blue">70</text>
  <text x="170" y="75" font-size="16" fill="blue">14</text>

  <text x="80" y="145" font-size="14">7 × 12 = 7 × (10 + 2) = 70 + 14 = 84</text>
</svg>

### 6. Using Distributive Property for Mental Math
Apply to make calculations easier:
- "Calculate $8 \times 19$ by thinking $8 \times (20 - 1) = 8 \times 20 - 8 \times 1 = 160 - 8 = 152$"
- "$9 \times 11 = 9 \times (10 + 1) = ?$"
- "$5 \times 98 = 5 \times (100 - 2) = ?$"
- "Which is easier: $6 \times 25$ or $6 \times (20 + 5)$?"
- Example: $7 \times 18 = 7 \times (10 + 8) = 70 + 56 = 126$

### 7. Doubling and Halving Strategy
Use relationships for easier multiplication:
- "If $5 \times 8 = 40$, then $10 \times 8 = ?$ (double the 5)"
- "If $25 \times 4 = 100$, what is $25 \times 8$?"
- "If $12 \times 6 = 72$, what is $12 \times 3$?" (half of 6)
- Create chains:
  - $3 \times 8 = 24$
  - $6 \times 8 = ?$ (double)
  - $12 \times 8 = ?$ (double again)

### 8. Combining Properties for Efficient Calculation
Mix multiple strategies:
- "$15 + 28 + 5 = ?$" (regroup: $15 + 5 + 28 = 20 + 28 = 48$)
- "$4 \times 13 \times 5 = ?$" (regroup: $4 \times 5 \times 13 = 20 \times 13 = 260$)
- "Calculate $8 \times 15$ efficiently" (could use $8 \times (10 + 5)$ or $(4 \times 2) \times 15$)
- Compare methods: Show 2-3 different ways to solve the same problem

### 9. Pattern Recognition with Properties
Discover arithmetic patterns:
- Number sequences using doubling: $5, 10, 20, 40, ...$
- "What's the pattern? How does it relate to multiplication?"
- Missing numbers in property statements:
  - $? + 17 = 17 + 23$
  - $6 \times ? = 8 \times 6$
  - $(5 + 9) + ? = 5 + (9 + 11)$

### 10. Problem Solving with Arithmetic Laws
Apply properties to real situations:
- "A store sells 8 packs of 12 pencils. Calculate the total using the distributive property."
- "You need to add 47 + 18 + 3. What's the smartest way to calculate this?"
- "Which is faster to calculate: $(25 \times 8) \times 4$ or $25 \times (8 \times 4)$? Explain."
- Multi-step: "If $6 \times 15 = 90$, use this to find $12 \times 15$ and $6 \times 30$"

## Difficulty Scaling

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy):**
- Simple commutative property with small numbers
- Direct property identification
- Fill-in-the-blank with clear patterns
- Numbers under 20
- Example: "If $5 + 8 = 13$, what is $8 + 5$?"

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium):**
- Associative property with strategic grouping
- Basic distributive property ($n \times 12$, $n \times 15$)
- Doubling strategies
- Numbers 10-50
- Example: "Calculate $7 \times 13$ using $7 \times (10 + 3)$"

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard):**
- Complex distributive property with subtraction
- Combining multiple properties
- Strategy comparison and justification
- Larger numbers (50-100)
- Multi-step applications
- Example: "Calculate $8 \times 99$ efficiently. Explain which property you used and why."
