# Collecting and Representing Data

Create tasks where {{child_name}} collects, organizes, and represents data using various methods appropriate for grade 5 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Frequency Tables from Raw Data**: Present a list of {{15-25}} data points (favorite colors, sports, subjects, etc.) and ask the student to create a frequency table. Vary the number of categories and data points.

2. **Creating Bar Charts**: Provide frequency data and ask the student to draw or describe a bar chart. Include tasks about choosing appropriate scales (by 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s) based on the data range.

3. **Pie Chart Representation**: Give simple percentage or fractional data (e.g., $\frac{1}{4}$ prefer soccer, $\frac{1}{2}$ prefer basketball) and ask to create or interpret a pie chart. Use multiples of 5% or simple fractions.

4. **Data Collection Planning**: Ask the student to design a survey question and explain how they would collect and organize the data. Include considerations about sample size and fair sampling.

5. **Comparing Representations**: Show the same data in different formats (table, bar chart, pictogram) and ask which is most useful for answering specific questions.

6. **Reading and Interpreting**: Provide a chart or table with real-world data (class test scores, monthly rainfall, library book checkouts) and ask questions requiring interpretation. Vary between finding maximums, minimums, totals, and comparisons.

7. **Creating Line Plots**: For measurement data (heights, arm spans, pencil lengths in cm), create dot plots or line plots showing distribution. Include finding mode and range.

8. **Two-Way Frequency Tables**: Simple cross-tabulation with two categories (e.g., boys/girls × favorite subject). Ask students to fill in missing totals or find specific frequencies.

Use concrete, age-appropriate contexts: class surveys, sports teams, pets, hobbies, school activities, weather, favorite books/movies. Ensure data sets are manageable (10-30 data points) and include clear instructions about what type of representation to create.
