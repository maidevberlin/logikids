# Fraction Multiplication

Create diverse problems for multiplying fractions, including fraction by fraction, whole number by fraction, and mixed numbers, with emphasis on simplification strategies.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Basic Fraction Multiplication
Calculate: $\frac{{{num1}}}{{{denom1}}} \times \frac{{{num2}}}{{{denom2}}}$

**Show the rule:**
$$\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}$$

**Steps:**
1. Multiply the numerators: ${{num1}} \times {{num2}}$
2. Multiply the denominators: ${{denom1}} \times {{denom2}}$
3. Simplify the result to lowest terms

### 2. Fraction Times Whole Number
Calculate: ${{whole}} \times \frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}}$

**Method 1:** Multiply numerator by whole number
$${{whole}} \times \frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}} = \frac{{{whole}} \times {{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}}$$

**Method 2:** Write whole number as fraction
$$\frac{{{whole}}}{1} \times \frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}} = \frac{{{whole}} \times {{numerator}}}{1 \times {{denominator}}}$$

Simplify and convert to a mixed number if necessary.

### 3. Simplify Before Multiplying
Calculate: $\frac{{{a}}}{{{b}}} \times \frac{{{c}}}{{{d}}}$

**Strategy:** Cancel common factors before multiplying to make calculations easier.

1. Look for common factors between any numerator and any denominator
2. Cancel common factors by dividing
3. Multiply the simplified fractions
4. The result is already in simplest form

**Show the cancellation process clearly with crossed-out numbers.**

### 4. Recipe Scaling Problem
A recipe for {{servings1}} people calls for $\frac{{{ingredient_num}}}{{{ingredient_denom}}}$ cups of an ingredient. You want to make the recipe for {{servings2}} people.

a) What fraction represents the scaling factor? ($\frac{{{servings2}}}{{{servings1}}}$)
b) Calculate: $\frac{{{servings2}}}{{{servings1}}} \times \frac{{{ingredient_num}}}{{{ingredient_denom}}}$
c) How many cups of the ingredient do you need?
d) If the original recipe also needs $\frac{{{other_ingredient}}}{{{other_denom}}}$ cups of another ingredient, how much of that do you need for {{servings2}} people?

### 5. Area Calculation with Fractions
A rectangular garden has length $\frac{{{length_num}}}{{{length_denom}}}$ meters and width $\frac{{{width_num}}}{{{width_denom}}}$ meters.

a) Calculate the area using: $A = l \times w$
b) Express the area as a simplified fraction
c) Convert to a decimal (rounded to 2 decimal places)
d) If grass seed covers ${{coverage}}$ m² per bag, how many bags are needed?

**Area formula:**
$$A = \frac{{{length_num}}}{{{length_denom}}} \times \frac{{{width_num}}}{{{width_denom}}} = ?$$

### 6. Mixed Number Multiplication
Calculate: ${{whole1}}\frac{{{frac1}}}{{{denom1}}} \times {{whole2}}\frac{{{frac2}}}{{{denom2}}}$

**Process:**
1. Convert both mixed numbers to improper fractions
   - ${{whole1}}\frac{{{frac1}}}{{{denom1}}} = \frac{?}{{{denom1}}}$
   - ${{whole2}}\frac{{{frac2}}}{{{denom2}}} = \frac{?}{{{denom2}}}$
2. Multiply the improper fractions
3. Simplify the result
4. Convert back to a mixed number

### 7. Fraction of a Fraction
What is $\frac{{{part_num}}}{{{part_denom}}}$ of $\frac{{{whole_num}}}{{{whole_denom}}}$?

**Explain:** "Of" means multiplication in mathematics.

$$\frac{{{part_num}}}{{{part_denom}}} \text{ of } \frac{{{whole_num}}}{{{whole_denom}}} = \frac{{{part_num}}}{{{part_denom}}} \times \frac{{{whole_num}}}{{{whole_denom}}}$$

a) Calculate the product
b) Simplify the result
c) Compare: Is the answer larger or smaller than $\frac{{{whole_num}}}{{{whole_denom}}}$? Why?

### 8. Multi-Step Word Problem - Shopping
Sarah spent $\frac{{{spent_num}}}{{{spent_denom}}}$ of her money on books. She then spent $\frac{{{additional}}}{{{additional_denom}}}$ of her remaining money on snacks.

a) What fraction of her original money did she spend on snacks?
b) If she started with {{total_money}} dollars, how much did she spend on books?
c) How much did she spend on snacks?
d) How much money does she have left?

**Show calculations:**
| Item | Fraction Calculation | Amount ($) |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| Books | | |
| Remaining after books | | |
| Snacks | | |
| Final remaining | | |

### 9. Three Fractions Chain Multiplication
Calculate: $\frac{{{x}}}{{{y}}} \times \frac{{{z}}}{{{w}}} \times \frac{{{p}}}{{{q}}}$

**Strategy:**
1. Look for opportunities to simplify before multiplying
2. Cancel common factors across all numerators and denominators
3. Multiply the simplified fractions
4. Check if the final answer can be simplified further

### 10. Comparing Products
Given fractions: $\frac{{{a1}}}{{{b1}}}$ and $\frac{{{a2}}}{{{b2}}}$

a) Calculate: $\frac{{{a1}}}{{{b1}}} \times \frac{{{a2}}}{{{b2}}}$
b) Calculate: $\frac{{{a1}}}{{{b1}}} + \frac{{{a2}}}{{{b2}}}$
c) Which result is larger: the product or the sum?
d) Will the product of two proper fractions always be less than their sum? Explain with an example.

**Use a table:**
| Operation | Calculation | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Multiplication | | |
| Addition | | |

### 11. Distance and Rate Problem
A cyclist travels at ${{speed}}\frac{{{speed_frac}}}{{{speed_denom}}}$ km per hour for $\frac{{{time_num}}}{{{time_denom}}}$ hours.

a) Calculate the distance traveled using: $d = r \times t$
b) If another cyclist travels $\frac{{{other_time}}}{{{other_denom}}}$ hours at the same speed, how far do they travel?
c) What is the difference in distances?

**Distance formula:**
$$d = {{speed}}\frac{{{speed_frac}}}{{{speed_denom}}} \times \frac{{{time_num}}}{{{time_denom}}}$$

## Task Requirements
- Mix simple fractions, improper fractions, and mixed numbers
- Include problems where simplifying before multiplying is advantageous
- Provide at least 2 real-world contexts (recipes, area, shopping, distance)
- Use varied denominators (2-12)
- Show both the cancellation method and direct multiplication
- Always express final answers in simplest form
- Convert improper fractions to mixed numbers when appropriate
- Ensure significantly different numerical values across task generations
