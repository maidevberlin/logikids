# Investigating Solids

Create tasks where {{child_name}} investigates properties, nets, surface area, and volume of prisms, pyramids, and cylinders appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Identifying Prisms and Pyramids**: Distinguish between prisms (two parallel congruent bases) and pyramids (one base, apex). "Is this solid a prism or pyramid? What shape is the base?" Use triangular prism, rectangular prism (box), pentagonal prism, triangular pyramid, square pyramid. Show SVG oblique views.

2. **Properties of Prisms**: Count faces, edges, vertices for various prisms. "A {{triangular}} prism has __ faces, __ edges, and __ vertices." Rectangular prism: 6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices. Triangular prism: 5 faces, 9 edges, 6 vertices. Connect to Euler's formula: $V - E + F = 2$.

3. **Nets of Solids**: Match nets to solids or vice versa. Show {{2-4}} nets and ask which creates a {{rectangular prism/triangular prism/square pyramid/cylinder}}. Include some incorrect nets. Use clear SVG diagrams showing fold lines as dashed.

4. **Volume of Rectangular Prisms**: Calculate using $V = l \times w \times h$. "Find the volume of a box with length ${{8}}$ cm, width ${{5}}$ cm, height ${{3}}$ cm." Use whole number dimensions ({{3-12}} cm). Include real contexts: "How much water fits in an aquarium {{40}} cm × {{25}} cm × {{30}} cm?"

5. **Volume of Cubes**: Calculate using $V = s^3$. "A cube has edge length ${{7}}$ cm. What is its volume?" Use edge lengths {{4-10}} cm. Compare to rectangular prisms: "Which has greater volume: a cube with edge {{5}} cm or a box {{6}} cm × {{4}} cm × {{5}} cm?"

6. **Surface Area of Rectangular Prisms**: Calculate by finding area of all 6 faces. "A box is {{6}} cm × {{4}} cm × {{3}} cm. Find the surface area." Formula: $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$. Use dimensions {{3-10}} cm. Include contexts like wrapping paper needed.

7. **Surface Area of Cubes**: Calculate using $SA = 6s^2$. "A cube has edge length ${{5}}$ cm. Find its surface area." Use edge lengths {{4-8}} cm. Connect to real contexts: painting a storage cube, wrapping a gift box.

8. **Volume and Surface Area of Cylinders**: Introduce formulas using $\pi \approx 3.14$ or $\approx 3$. Volume: $V = \pi r^2 h$ where $r =$ radius, $h =$ height. Surface area: $SA = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$ (two circles plus rectangle). "A can has radius {{3}} cm and height {{10}} cm. Estimate its volume." Use simple values where calculation is manageable.

Use clear SVG diagrams showing dimensions labeled. For prisms, show the base shape and height. For cylinders, show radius and height. For nets, use dashed lines for folds.

Present formulas clearly:
- **Rectangular Prism**: $V = l \times w \times h$, $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$
- **Cube**: $V = s^3$, $SA = 6s^2$
- **Cylinder**: $V = \pi r^2 h$, $SA = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh$

Include tables for organizing information:

| Solid | Length | Width | Height | Volume |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Box A | ${{6}}$ cm | ${{4}}$ cm | ${{5}}$ cm | ? |
| Box B | ${{8}}$ cm | ${{3}}$ cm | ${{4}}$ cm | ? |

Emphasize units: volume in cm³ or m³, surface area in cm² or m². Connect to real contexts: packaging efficiency, material needed for construction, water tank capacity, painting surface areas. For cylinders, allow both exact answers (using $\pi$) and approximations (using $3.14$ or $3$).
