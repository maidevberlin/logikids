Generate a task that helps students practice transforming algebraic terms through combining like terms, factoring, and expanding expressions.

**Task variations to include:**

1. **Combining Like Terms (Basic)**
   - Simplify expressions like ${{a}}x + {{b}}x - {{c}}x$
   - Combine terms with different variables: ${{a}}x + {{b}}y + {{c}}x - {{d}}y$
   - Include constants: ${{a}}x + {{b}} + {{c}}x - {{d}}$
   - Use larger coefficients: ${{a}}a + {{b}}a + {{c}}a$ where coefficients range from 5-20

2. **Combining Like Terms (Advanced)**
   - Multiple variables with different powers: ${{a}}x^2 + {{b}}x + {{c}}x^2 - {{d}}x + {{e}}$
   - Three or more variables: ${{a}}x + {{b}}y + {{c}}z + {{d}}x - {{e}}z + {{f}}y$
   - Mixed operations with negative terms: ${{a}}m - {{b}}n + {{c}}m + {{d}}n - {{e}}m$
   - Expressions with fractions: $\frac{{{a}}}{{{b}}}x + \frac{{{c}}}{{{d}}}x$

3. **Expanding Using Distributive Property**
   - Basic expansion: ${{a}}(x + {{b}})$ or ${{a}}({{b}} - x)$
   - Expansion with two terms: ${{a}}({{b}}x + {{c}})$ or ${{a}}({{b}}x - {{c}}y)$
   - Negative factors: $-{{a}}(x + {{b}})$ or $-{{a}}({{b}}x - {{c}})$
   - Variable factors: $x({{a}} + {{b}}x)$ or ${{a}}x({{b}} + {{c}}y)$

4. **Factoring Out Common Factors**
   - Simple factoring: ${{a}}x + {{a}}{{b}}$ = ${{a}}(x + {{b}})$
   - Factor from multiple terms: ${{a}}{{b}}x + {{a}}{{c}}y$ = ${{a}}({{b}}x + {{c}}y)$
   - Factor with subtraction: ${{a}}{{b}}m - {{a}}{{c}}n$
   - Factor variable terms: ${{a}}x^2 + {{b}}x$ = $x({{a}}x + {{b}})$

5. **Combined Operations (Expand Then Simplify)**
   - ${{a}}(x + {{b}}) + {{c}}(x + {{d}})$ - expand both, then combine like terms
   - ${{a}}({{b}}x + {{c}}) - {{d}}({{e}}x - {{f}})$ - expand and simplify
   - ${{a}}x + {{b}}(x + {{c}})$ - expand second term, then combine
   - ${{a}}(x - {{b}}) + {{c}}x - {{d}}$ - expand and collect all like terms

6. **Combined Operations (Simplify Then Factor)**
   - Simplify ${{a}}x + {{b}}x + {{c}}y + {{d}}y$, then factor the result
   - Combine ${{a}}{{b}}m + {{c}}{{d}}m$ and factor out the GCF
   - Simplify expressions with multiple variables and factor common terms

7. **Word Problems Requiring Term Transformation**
   - Create an expression for total cost/distance/area and simplify
   - Example: "Sarah buys ${{a}}$ books at $x$ euros each and ${{b}}$ notebooks at $x$ euros each. She also spends ${{c}}$ euros on pens. Write and simplify an expression for her total cost."
   - Perimeter problems: "A rectangle has length ${{a}}x + {{b}}$ and width ${{c}}x + {{d}}$. Find a simplified expression for the perimeter."

8. **Error Analysis Tasks**
   - Present an incorrectly simplified expression and ask students to find and correct the error
   - Example: "Tim simplified ${{a}}(x + {{b}}) + {{c}}x$ to ${{a}}x + {{b}} + {{c}}x$. What mistake did he make? What is the correct answer?"
   - Common errors: forgetting to distribute to all terms, incorrectly combining unlike terms, sign errors

9. **Multi-Step Transformation Challenges**
   - ${{a}}({{b}}x + {{c}}) + {{d}}({{e}}x - {{f}}) - {{g}}x$ - expand, combine, then factor if possible
   - Expressions with nested operations requiring multiple transformation steps
   - Real-world contexts requiring setup, expansion, simplification, and interpretation

**Difficulty scaling:**
- **Easy**: Single-step combining like terms with 2-3 terms, basic expansion with single-digit numbers
- **Medium**: Multi-step problems, combining then expanding, or expanding then combining, numbers up to 20
- **Hard**: Complex multi-step transformations, error analysis, word problems requiring expression setup

**Output format:**
- Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions
- Show step-by-step solutions with clear explanations
- For word problems, include the expression setup phase
- Highlight key algebraic properties being used (distributive property, combining like terms, factoring)

**Example placeholder usage:**
- Use ${{a}}$, ${{b}}$, ${{c}}$, etc. for coefficients (typically 1-20)
- Ensure variety in values across task generations
- Use appropriate variable names ($x$, $y$, $z$, $m$, $n$, $a$, $b$) that fit the context
