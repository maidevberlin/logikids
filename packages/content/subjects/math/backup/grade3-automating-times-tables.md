# Automating Times Tables

Generate tasks that help students master multiplication facts through varied practice and pattern recognition.

## Task Variations

### 1. Direct Multiplication Facts
Present straightforward multiplication problems focusing on automaticity:
- Calculate ${{num1}} \times {{num2}}$ where numbers range from 2 to 10
- Use a variety of combinations, not just sequential (e.g., $7 \times 9$, $4 \times 6$, $8 \times 5$)
- Include both smaller products (e.g., $3 \times 4 = 12$) and larger ones (e.g., $9 \times 8 = 72$)
- Example: "What is $6 \times 7$?"

### 2. Inverse Operations (Division)
Connect division to known multiplication facts:
- Present division as ${{product}} \div {{factor}} = ?$
- Use products from the times tables (e.g., $48 \div 6$, $63 \div 9$)
- Ask "If you know that $8 \times 7 = 56$, what is $56 \div 8$?"
- Include word problems: "{{num}} candies shared equally among {{divisor}} children"

### 3. Commutative Property
Reinforce that order doesn't matter in multiplication:
- Present pairs: "If $5 \times 8 = 40$, what is $8 \times 5$?"
- Create fill-in problems: "$6 \times 9 = 9 \times ?$"
- Use tables to show the pattern:

| $\times$ | 4 | 7 |
|----------|---|---|
| **7**    | ? | 49 |
| **4**    | 16 | ? |

### 4. Missing Factor Problems
Develop algebraic thinking:
- Present as "$? \times 6 = 42$" or "$8 \times ? = 72$"
- Use real-world contexts: "Each box contains 7 apples. How many boxes do you need for 56 apples?"
- Vary difficulty: easier missing factors (e.g., $? \times 5 = 30$) and harder ones (e.g., $? \times 9 = 63$)

### 5. Fact Families
Show relationships between multiplication and division:
- Present one fact, ask for three related facts: "If $6 \times 8 = 48$, write three other facts using 6, 8, and 48"
- Create completion tasks:
  - $7 \times 9 = 63$
  - $9 \times 7 = ?$
  - $63 \div 7 = ?$
  - $? \div 9 = 7$

### 6. Times Table Patterns
Identify and extend patterns:
- Skip counting: "Continue the pattern: $5, 10, 15, 20, ...$"
- Pattern rules: "What pattern do you notice in the 9 times table? ($9, 18, 27, 36, ...$)"
- Create tables showing patterns:

| $n$ | $4 \times n$ |
|-----|--------------|
| 1   | 4            |
| 2   | 8            |
| 3   | ?            |
| 4   | ?            |
| 5   | ?            |

### 7. Multi-Step Word Problems
Apply times tables in context:
- "A school has 8 classrooms with 6 rows of desks. Each row has 4 desks. How many desks in total?"
- "Sarah practices piano 7 days a week for 9 minutes each day. How many minutes does she practice in one week?"
- Vary the numbers and contexts (sports teams, garden plots, sticker collections)

### 8. Speed Challenges
Build automaticity with timed elements:
- "How many can you solve in {{time}} seconds?" with 5-8 mixed facts
- Create grids of facts: Fill in products for $6 \times 3$, $7 \times 8$, $4 \times 9$, $5 \times 6$, $8 \times 8$
- Mix operations: "$6 \times 7 = ?$, $48 \div 6 = ?$, $? \times 5 = 45$"

## Difficulty Scaling

**Easy ({{difficulty}} = easy):**
- Focus on 2, 5, 10 times tables
- Use smaller numbers (2-5)
- Direct multiplication only
- Example: $5 \times 4 = ?$

**Medium ({{difficulty}} = medium):**
- Include all tables 2-10
- Mix multiplication and division
- Use commutative property
- Example: "If $8 \times 6 = 48$, what is $48 \div 6$?"

**Hard ({{difficulty}} = hard):**
- Missing factors and fact families
- Multi-step word problems
- Larger numbers (7-10)
- Pattern recognition
- Example: "A bakery makes 9 trays of cookies with 8 cookies on each tray. They sell 35 cookies. How many are left?"
