# Introduction to Integers

Create tasks where {{child_name}} works with positive and negative integers in context and on number lines appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Understanding Negative Numbers in Context**: Present real-world scenarios. "The temperature is ${{-8}}$°C. What does this mean?" or "Your bank account shows ${{-25}}$ dollars. What does this mean?" Use contexts: temperature, elevation (above/below sea level), profits/losses, time (BC/AD), floors (above/below ground).

2. **Number Line Representation**: Plot integers on a number line. "Show the numbers ${{-4}}$, ${{0}}$, and ${{3}}$ on a number line." Or: "Which number is further right: ${{-3}}$ or ${{-7}}$?" Use number lines from {{-10}} to {{10}}.

3. **Comparing and Ordering Integers**: Compare integers using $<$, $>$, or $=$. "Which is greater: ${{-5}}$ or ${{-2}}$?" or "Order from smallest to largest: ${{3}}$, ${{-4}}$, ${{0}}$, ${{-1}}$, ${{2}}$." Include negative and positive numbers.

4. **Absolute Value**: Calculate or compare absolute values. "Find $|{{-7}}|$" or "Which is greater: $|{{-8}}|$ or $|{{5}}|$?" or "Two numbers have absolute value {{6}}. What could they be?" ($6$ and $-6$). Use number line to show distance from zero.

5. **Adding Integers (Same Signs)**: Add integers with same signs. "${{-5}} + ({{-3}}) = $ ?" (Answer: $-8$) or "${{7}} + {{4}} = $ ?" Use models: moving on number line, temperature changes, gaining/losing money. Present as: "Start at ${{-5}}$, move left {{3}}. Where are you?"

6. **Adding Integers (Different Signs)**: Add integers with opposite signs. "${{-8}} + {{5}} = $ ?" (Answer: $-3$) or "${{6}} + ({{-9}}) = $ ?" (Answer: $-3$). Use number line or context: "Temperature is ${{-8}}$°C, rises {{5}}°C. New temperature?"

7. **Subtracting Integers**: Rewrite subtraction as adding the opposite. "${{3}} - {{7}} = $ ?" becomes "${{3}} + ({{-7}}) = {{-4}}$" or "${{-5}} - ({{-3}}) = $ ?" becomes "${{-5}} + {{3}} = {{-2}}$". Emphasize: subtracting is adding the opposite. Use contexts like temperature drops or debt repayment.

8. **Multi-Step Integer Problems**: Combine operations. "Start with ${{-4}}$. Add {{7}}. Then subtract {{5}}. What's the result?" or "Monday: ${{-3}}$°C. Tuesday: rose {{8}}°C. Wednesday: dropped {{6}}°C. What's Wednesday's temperature?" Vary the number of steps ({{2-4}}).

Use number lines extensively to visualize operations:
- Moving right = adding positive or subtracting negative
- Moving left = adding negative or subtracting positive

Present key rules:
- $|a|$ = distance from zero (always positive or zero)
- $a + b$ where both positive or both negative: add magnitudes, keep sign
- $a + b$ where different signs: subtract smaller magnitude from larger, take sign of larger magnitude
- $a - b = a + (-b)$ (change subtraction to adding the opposite)

Include context problems: "A submarine is at ${{-150}}$ m (below sea level). It rises {{80}} m. What is its new depth?" Answer: $-150 + 80 = -70$ m.

Use tables for temperature or elevation changes:

| Time | Temperature | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Morning | ${{-6}}$°C | - |
| Noon | ? | Rose ${{10}}$°C |
| Evening | ? | Dropped ${{5}}$°C |
