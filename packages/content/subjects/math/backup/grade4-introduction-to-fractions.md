# Introduction to Fractions

Create tasks that help students understand fractions as parts of a whole, compare fractions, and apply them to real-world quantities.

## Problem Variations

**Variation 1: Visual Fraction Recognition**
Look at this rectangle divided into equal parts:

<svg width="400" height="120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="20" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="#3b82f6" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="#3b82f6" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="180" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="#3b82f6" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="260" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="340" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
</svg>

a) How many equal parts is the rectangle divided into?
b) How many parts are shaded?
c) What fraction of the rectangle is shaded?

Answer: $\frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}}$ (read as "{{numerator}} out of {{denominator}}")

**Variation 2: Fraction on Number Line**
Place the fraction $\frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}}$ on the number line:

<svg width="500" height="80" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <line x1="50" y1="40" x2="450" y2="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <line x1="50" y1="35" x2="50" y2="45" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="50" y="60" font-size="14" text-anchor="middle">0</text>
  <line x1="450" y1="35" x2="450" y2="45" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="450" y="60" font-size="14" text-anchor="middle">1</text>
  <!-- Add tick marks for denominator divisions -->
</svg>

Divide the segment from 0 to 1 into {{denominator}} equal parts, then mark where $\frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}}$ belongs.

**Variation 3: Comparing Fractions**
Which fraction is larger? Use pictures or reasoning to explain.

a) $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{3}$?

Hint: Imagine dividing a pizza into 2 pieces vs. 3 pieces. Which piece is bigger?

| Fraction | Visual | Size |
|----------|--------|------|
| $\frac{1}{2}$ | Half of the whole | Larger piece |
| $\frac{1}{3}$ | One third of the whole | Smaller piece |

Answer: $\frac{1}{2} > \frac{1}{3}$ because halves are bigger than thirds.

b) Compare: $\frac{{{num_a}}}{{{den_a}}}$ and $\frac{{{num_b}}}{{{den_b}}}$

**Variation 4: Fractions with Real Quantities**
Calculate the following:

a) $\frac{1}{2}$ of ${{quantity}}$ {{unit}} = ?
b) $\frac{1}{4}$ of ${{quantity}}$ {{unit}} = ?
c) $\frac{3}{4}$ of ${{quantity}}$ {{unit}} = ?

Example: $\frac{3}{4}$ of 8 liters
- First find $\frac{1}{4}$: $8 \div 4 = 2$ liters
- Then multiply by 3: $2 \times 3 = 6$ liters
- Answer: $\frac{3}{4}$ of 8 liters = 6 liters

**Variation 5: Shading Fractions**
Draw a shape divided into {{total_parts}} equal parts. Shade $\frac{{{shaded_parts}}}{{{total_parts}}}$ of it.

Instructions:
1. Draw a rectangle (or circle)
2. Divide it into {{total_parts}} equal parts
3. Color exactly {{shaded_parts}} parts

**Variation 6: Equivalent Fractions Introduction**
These two shapes show the same fraction:

<svg width="400" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- First shape: 1/2 -->
  <rect x="20" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="#3b82f6" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="80" height="80" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="90" y="120" font-size="14" text-anchor="middle">$\frac{1}{2}$</text>

  <!-- Second shape: 2/4 -->
  <rect x="220" y="20" width="40" height="80" fill="#3b82f6" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="260" y="20" width="40" height="80" fill="#3b82f6" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="300" y="20" width="40" height="80" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <rect x="340" y="20" width="40" height="80" fill="white" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>
  <text x="280" y="120" font-size="14" text-anchor="middle">$\frac{2}{4}$</text>
</svg>

Both show half! So $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}$

Find another fraction equal to $\frac{{{numerator}}}{{{denominator}}}$.

**Variation 7: Word Problems with Fractions**
Maria has {{total_items}} cookies. She wants to give $\frac{{{fraction_num}}}{{{fraction_den}}}$ of them to her friend.

a) How many cookies does she give to her friend?
b) How many cookies does Maria keep?

Solution:
- Total cookies: {{total_items}}
- Friend gets: $\frac{{{fraction_num}}}{{{fraction_den}}}$ of {{total_items}} = ${{total_items}} \div {{fraction_den}} \times {{fraction_num}} = {{given_amount}}$
- Maria keeps: ${{total_items}} - {{given_amount}} = {{remaining}}$

**Variation 8: Fraction Ordering**
Order these fractions from smallest to largest:

$$\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3}{4}$$

Strategy:
- All have numerator 1 except the last one
- The larger the denominator, the smaller the fraction (when numerator is 1)
- $\frac{3}{4}$ means three of the $\frac{1}{4}$ pieces

Answer: $\frac{1}{8} < \frac{1}{4} < \frac{1}{2} < \frac{3}{4}$
