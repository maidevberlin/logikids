# Large Numbers

Create tasks that help students read, write, understand place value, and round large numbers up to 1,000,000.

## Problem Variations

**Variation 1: Reading and Writing Large Numbers**
Write this number in digits: {{number_words}}

Example: "Three hundred forty-five thousand, six hundred seventy-eight"

Think about place value:
- Hundred thousands: 3
- Ten thousands: 4
- Thousands: 5
- Hundreds: 6
- Tens: 7
- Ones: 8

Answer: $345,678$

Now write {{number_digits}} in words.

**Variation 2: Place Value Understanding**
In the number ${{large_number}}$, what digit is in the {{place_name}} place?

| Place | Digit |
|-------|-------|
| Ones | ? |
| Tens | ? |
| Hundreds | ? |
| Thousands | ? |
| Ten thousands | ? |
| Hundred thousands | ? |

Example: In $526,347$, the digit in the ten thousands place is $2$.

**Variation 3: Expanded Form**
Write ${{number}}$ in expanded form.

Example: $456,789 = 400,000 + 50,000 + 6,000 + 700 + 80 + 9$

Or using multiplication:
$$456,789 = (4 \times 100,000) + (5 \times 10,000) + (6 \times 1,000) + (7 \times 100) + (8 \times 10) + (9 \times 1)$$

**Variation 4: Comparing Large Numbers**
Use $<$, $>$, or $=$ to compare:

a) ${{number_a}}$ ___ ${{number_b}}$
b) ${{number_c}}$ ___ ${{number_d}}$

Strategy: Compare digits from left to right, starting with the highest place value.

Example: Compare $456,789$ and $462,345$
- Hundred thousands: both have 4
- Ten thousands: 5 vs. 6 → 5 < 6
- So $456,789 < 462,345$

**Variation 5: Rounding to Different Places**
Round ${{number}}$ to the nearest:

| Round to | Rounded number | Explanation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Ten | ? | Look at ones digit |
| Hundred | ? | Look at tens digit |
| Thousand | ? | Look at hundreds digit |
| Ten thousand | ? | Look at thousands digit |

Example: Round $456,789$ to the nearest thousand:
- Look at hundreds digit: 7
- Since 7 ≥ 5, round up
- Answer: $457,000$

**Variation 6: Real-World Population Problem**
The population of different cities:

| City | Population |
|------|------------|
| {{city_a}} | {{pop_a}} |
| {{city_b}} | {{pop_b}} |
| {{city_c}} | {{pop_c}} |

a) Which city has the largest population?
b) Round each population to the nearest ten thousand.
c) What is the difference between the largest and smallest populations?

**Variation 7: Number Patterns with Large Numbers**
Continue the pattern:

${{start}}, {{step_1}}, {{step_2}}, ?, ?, ?$

Example: $125,000, 150,000, 175,000, ...$
- Pattern: Add $25,000$ each time
- Next numbers: $200,000, 225,000, 250,000$

**Variation 8: Multi-Step Place Value Problem**
Create a number using these clues:
- The digit in the hundred thousands place is {{d6}}
- The digit in the ten thousands place is {{d5}}
- The digit in the thousands place is {{d4}}
- The digit in the hundreds place is {{d3}}
- The digit in the tens place is {{d2}}
- The digit in the ones place is {{d1}}

What is the number?

Now:
a) Write it in expanded form
b) Round it to the nearest ten thousand
c) Write it in words
