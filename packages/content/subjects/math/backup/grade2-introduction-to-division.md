# Introduction to Division

Generate tasks that introduce division as both sharing (partitive) and grouping (quotitive). Emphasize the relationship between multiplication and division using simple, concrete examples.

## Task Variations

### 1. Division as Sharing (Partitive)
Equal sharing among groups:

Share ${{total}}$ {{object}} equally among ${{groups}}$ {{people}}.

How many does each {{person}} get?

$${{total}} \div {{groups}} = \text{?}$$

**Example:** Share 12 cookies equally among 3 children. How many does each child get?

---

### 2. Division as Grouping (Quotitive)
Making equal groups:

You have ${{total}}$ {{object}}. Put them into groups of ${{group_size}}$.

How many groups can you make?

$${{total}} \div {{group_size}} = \text{?}$$

**Example:** You have 15 apples. Put them into baskets of 5. How many baskets do you need?

---

### 3. Division as Inverse of Multiplication
Show the relationship:

If ${{num1}} \times {{num2}} = {{product}}$, then ${{product}} \div {{num1}} = $ ?

**Example:** If $3 \times 4 = 12$, then $12 \div 3 = ?$ (Answer: 4)

---

### 4. Simple Division Facts
Basic division calculations:

Calculate: ${{dividend}} \div {{divisor}} = $ ?

Use numbers within multiplication tables (÷2, ÷5, ÷10)

**Examples:**
- $10 \div 2 = ?$
- $20 \div 5 = ?$
- $30 \div 10 = ?$

---

### 5. Visual Division with Arrays
Use array representation:

Look at this array of dots:

```
● ● ● ●
● ● ● ●
● ● ● ●
```

There are ${{total}}$ dots in ${{rows}}$ rows.

How many dots in each row?

$${{total}} \div {{rows}} = \text{?}$$

---

### 6. Story Problems - Sharing
Word problems about fair sharing:

{{name}} has ${{total}}$ {{object}}. {{He/She}} wants to share them equally with ${{friends}}$ friends (including {{himself/herself}}).

How many {{object}} does each person get?

**Example:** Lisa has 20 stickers. She shares them equally with 4 friends (5 people total). How many does each person get?

---

### 7. Story Problems - Grouping
Word problems about making groups:

The teacher has ${{total}}$ {{object}}. She puts them into groups of ${{group_size}}$.

How many groups does she make?

**Example:** The teacher has 24 pencils. She puts them into boxes of 6. How many boxes does she make?

---

### 8. Division with Remainders (Introduction)
Simple introduction to remainders:

You have ${{total}}$ {{object}}. Share them equally among ${{groups}}$ {{people}}.

How many does each get? Are there any left over?

**Example:** Share 13 candies among 4 children. How many each? Any left over? (3 each, 1 left over)

---

### 9. Missing Number in Division
Find the missing value:

${{dividend}} \div \text{?} = {{quotient}}$

Or:

$\text{?} \div {{divisor}} = {{quotient}}$

**Example:** $12 \div ? = 4$ (Answer: 3)
