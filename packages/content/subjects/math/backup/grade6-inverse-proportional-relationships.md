# Inverse Proportional Relationships Tasks

Create problems that help students recognize and calculate with inverse proportional relationships, where one quantity increases as the other decreases. The relationship follows $y = \frac{k}{x}$ where $k$ is a constant.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Vary worker and time problems:** "{{number1}} workers need {{time1}} days to complete a job. How long would {{number2}} workers need?" where $\text{workers}_1 \times \text{days}_1 = \text{workers}_2 \times \text{days}_2$
- **Vary speed and time problems:** "A car traveling at {{speed1}} km/h needs {{time1}} hours for a journey. How long would it take at {{speed2}} km/h?" using $v_1 \times t_1 = v_2 \times t_2$
- **Vary area and dimension problems:** "A rectangle with length {{length1}} cm has width {{width1}} cm. If the length is changed to {{length2}} cm but the area stays constant, what is the new width?"
- **Vary sharing problems:** "{{amount}} chocolate bars are to be shared. If {{people1}} children share them, each gets {{bars1}} bars. How many bars would each child get if {{people2}} children share?"
- **Vary table completion:** Provide a table with inverse proportional values and ask students to identify the pattern and fill in missing values, e.g., $(2, 24), (3, 16), (4, ?), (6, ?), (8, ?)$ where $xy = 48$

**Vary the numbers:**
- For grade 6 beginning: Use simple whole numbers where products are easy to calculate (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12)
- For grade 6 intermediate: Include larger numbers and non-obvious products (15, 20, 25, 30)
- For advanced: Include decimal numbers (2.5 workers, 7.5 hours) and require rounding

**Vary the context:**
- Work scenarios: painters painting a house, builders constructing a wall, cleaners cleaning a building
- Travel scenarios: different speeds on the same route, trains vs. cars vs. bicycles
- Resource distribution: distributing food, money, or materials among different numbers of people
- Machinery scenarios: machines producing items at different rates, pumps filling tanks at different speeds
- Geometric scenarios: rectangles with constant area but varying dimensions

**Vary the question type:**
- Direct calculation: Find the unknown value using the inverse rule of three
- Comparison: "Which is faster: 4 workers in 6 days or 3 workers in 8 days?"
- Graph interpretation: Show a hyperbola $y = \frac{k}{x}$ and ask students to read values or identify the constant
- Word problems requiring setup: Students must first identify that the relationship is inverse proportional before calculating
- Table analysis: Given data, determine if the relationship is inverse proportional by checking if $x \times y = k$ (constant)

**Recognition exercises:**
- Present mixed scenarios and ask: "Is this proportional or inverse proportional?" Include scenarios like:
  - More workers → less time (inverse)
  - More apples → higher cost (proportional)
  - Higher speed → less time (inverse)
  - More pages → more reading time (proportional)

**Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions and formulas.**
