# Quadrilaterals

Create tasks where {{child_name}} identifies, describes, and calculates with quadrilaterals appropriate for grade 5 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Identifying Quadrilaterals**: Present descriptions or simple SVG diagrams and ask to identify the shape (square, rectangle, parallelogram, rhombus, trapezoid). "A quadrilateral with {{4 right angles and 4 equal sides}} is a __." Vary the properties given.

2. **Properties of Quadrilaterals**: True/false or multiple choice questions about properties. "True or false: All squares are rectangles." or "Which quadrilateral always has {{opposite sides parallel}}?" Include properties about sides, angles, and diagonals.

3. **Perimeter of Rectangles and Squares**: Calculate perimeter given dimensions. For rectangles: $P = 2l + 2w$ where $l = $ {{6-15}} cm and $w = $ {{4-10}} cm. For squares: $P = 4s$ where $s = $ {{5-12}} cm. Vary which measurements are given.

4. **Area of Rectangles and Squares**: Calculate area using $A = l \times w$ for rectangles and $A = s^2$ for squares. Use whole number dimensions ({{4-15}} cm). Include word problems: "A rectangular garden is {{8}} m long and {{6}} m wide. What is its area?"

5. **Area of Parallelograms**: Introduce formula $A = b \times h$. Provide base ({{6-12}} cm) and height ({{4-10}} cm). Emphasize that height is perpendicular to base. Use simple SVG diagrams showing base and height clearly labeled.

6. **Finding Missing Dimensions**: Given area or perimeter and one dimension, find the other. "A rectangle has area {{48}} cm² and width {{6}} cm. What is the length?" or "A square has perimeter {{32}} cm. What is the side length?"

7. **Comparing Quadrilaterals**: Present two quadrilaterals and ask to compare areas or perimeters. "Which has greater area: a square with side {{7}} cm or a rectangle {{9}} cm by {{5}} cm?" Vary so answers aren't always obvious.

8. **Composite Problems**: Combine identification with calculation. Show an SVG diagram of a quadrilateral with labeled dimensions and ask students to identify the shape AND calculate perimeter or area. Include real-world contexts.

Use SVG diagrams to show quadrilaterals clearly with dimensions labeled. Include grid paper representations where students can count units. Contexts: floor plans, gardens, picture frames, sports courts (basketball court is rectangle {{28}} m × {{15}} m). Emphasize units in answers (cm, m, cm², m²). For parallelograms, clearly distinguish base from slant side.
