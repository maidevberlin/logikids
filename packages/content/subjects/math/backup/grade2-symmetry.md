# Symmetry

Generate a task where {{name}} explores symmetry in shapes and patterns appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Use varied approaches:

**Completing Symmetrical Figures:**
- Present half of a figure with a line of symmetry and ask students to complete it
- Example: "Here is half of a heart shape. The dotted line is the line of symmetry. Draw the missing half."
- Use simple grid paper representations where students can count squares
- Describe the given half using coordinates or a grid description

**Identifying Symmetry:**
- Show multiple shapes and ask which ones are symmetrical
- Example: "Which of these letters are symmetrical: A, B, C, D, E, F?"
- Use everyday objects: "Which has symmetry: a butterfly, a tree, or a shoe?"

**Finding Lines of Symmetry:**
- Present a symmetrical shape and ask students to identify all lines of symmetry
- Example: "A rectangle has $2$ lines of symmetry. Draw them."
- Use shapes with varying numbers of symmetry lines: rectangles ($2$), squares ($4$), circles (infinite), triangles ($0$ to $3$)

**Nature and Objects:**
- Use familiar objects from nature or daily life
- Example: "Look at this leaf shape. Is it symmetrical? Draw the line of symmetry."
- Examples: butterflies, flowers, faces, stars

**Grid-Based Reflection:**
- Use simple coordinate grids where students reflect shapes
- Example: "On this grid, shape ABC has corners at $(2,1)$, $(4,1)$, and $(3,3)$. Reflect it across the line $x=5$. Where are the new corners?"

**Pattern Completion:**
- Show symmetrical patterns with missing pieces
- Example: "This pattern has a line of symmetry in the middle. Complete the pattern: ⭐🔵⭐ | ___"

**Multiple Symmetry Lines:**
- Explore shapes with more than one line of symmetry
- Example: "A square has $4$ lines of symmetry. Can you draw all of them?"

**Vertical vs Horizontal Symmetry:**
- Compare different orientations of symmetry lines
- Example: "This shape has vertical symmetry (up-down). Does it also have horizontal symmetry (left-right)?"

**Real Letters and Numbers:**
- Use capital letters and numbers to explore symmetry
- Example: "Which numbers from $0$ to $9$ are symmetrical?"
- Letters with vertical symmetry: A, H, M, etc.

Use simple SVG diagrams or grid descriptions when helpful. Describe shapes clearly so students can visualize them. Keep examples concrete and relatable for ages 7-8.
