# Probability Concepts

Generate tasks where students compare probabilities, estimate chances based on data, and understand basic probability concepts through experiments. Focus on developing intuition about likelihood and fairness in simple random events.

## Variation Guidelines

Create diverse tasks using these approaches:

1. **Marble Bag Comparisons**: Describe a bag containing {{total_marbles}} marbles in {{number_of_colors}} different colors with specific quantities. Ask students to compare probabilities: "Is it more likely to draw {{color_1}} or {{color_2}}?" Use different total quantities (10-20 marbles) and color distributions (e.g., 4 red, 3 blue, 2 green, 1 yellow).

2. **Spinner Probability**: Present a spinner divided into {{number_of_sections}} equal sections with {{number_of_colors}} different colors (some colors appearing multiple times). Students determine which outcomes are most/least likely, compare probabilities, and identify if the spinner is fair. Vary section totals (4, 6, 8, or 10 sections).

3. **Card Drawing**: Describe a deck of {{total_cards}} cards with different symbols, numbers, or colors. Ask students to compare the likelihood of drawing different types of cards. Example: "You have 12 cards: 5 hearts, 4 stars, 3 circles. Are you more likely to draw a heart or a star?"

4. **Dice Experiments**: Present data from rolling a die {{number_of_rolls}} times (e.g., 20, 30, or 40 rolls) showing how often each number appeared. Ask students to predict future outcomes, explain if results seem fair, or identify if a die might be biased. Provide realistic distributions (mostly balanced with small variations).

5. **Fair vs. Unfair Games**: Describe two different games or scenarios and ask students to determine which is fair and which gives an advantage to one player. Example: "Game A: Pick a card from 5 red and 5 blue. Game B: Pick a card from 7 red and 3 blue. Which game is fair for both players?"

6. **Prediction Based on Data**: Show results from an experiment (coin flips, spinner results, or marble draws over {{number_of_trials}} trials). Ask students to estimate the composition of the original setup. Example: "After 40 spins, blue appeared 20 times, red 15 times, green 5 times. What might the spinner look like?"

7. **Likelihood Language**: Present various scenarios and ask students to order them from least to most likely or to use probability language (impossible, unlikely, equally likely, likely, certain). Mix theoretical scenarios (rolling a 7 on a standard die is impossible) with practical ones (picking a red marble from mostly red marbles is likely).

8. **Simple Fractions**: For students ready for fractional representation, connect quantities to simple fractions. Example: "A bag has 4 red and 4 blue marbles. What fraction of the marbles are red? Is this $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, or $\frac{3}{4}$?" Keep fractions simple ($\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{2}{3}$, $\frac{3}{4}$).

**Contexts**: Use relatable objects like colored marbles, number cubes, spinners, cards with shapes/numbers, colored counters, letters in a bag, raffle tickets, or simple board game scenarios.

**Vary complexity** by changing total quantities (smaller for easier, larger for harder), number of categories (2-5 different colors/types), and whether probabilities are equal, clearly different, or similar enough to require careful comparison.
