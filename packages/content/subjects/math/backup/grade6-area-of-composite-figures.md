# Area of Composite Figures

Create tasks where {{child_name}} calculates areas of composite figures by decomposition appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **L-Shaped Figures**: Decompose L-shapes into two rectangles. Provide enough dimensions to calculate both rectangles. "An L-shaped garden has dimensions shown. Find the total area." Use total dimensions ({{8-15}} cm) with clear labels. Students must determine missing dimensions using subtraction.

2. **Rectangular Figures with Extensions**: Rectangle with additional rectangular section on side, top, or bottom. Give outer dimensions and some inner dimensions. Students calculate missing lengths, then find area of each part and sum. Vary which dimensions are provided.

3. **Figures with Triangles**: Rectangle topped with triangle (house shape), or triangle beside rectangle. For rectangle: $A = l \times w$. For triangle: $A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$. Provide base and height clearly labeled. Dimensions {{4-12}} cm.

4. **Rectilinear Figures (3+ rectangles)**: Complex shapes decomposable into {{3-4}} rectangles. "Divide this figure into rectangles, find each area, then find the total." Provide an SVG diagram with sufficient dimensions labeled. Some dimensions must be calculated from given information.

5. **Subtraction Method**: Large rectangle with smaller rectangle removed (creating U-shape or frame). "A rectangular lawn is {{10}} m × {{8}} m with a rectangular flower bed {{3}} m × {{2}} m. Find the grass area." Calculate large area minus small area.

6. **Finding Missing Dimensions**: Give composite figure with total area and some dimensions. Find missing dimension. "This L-shape has total area {{60}} cm². Part A is {{4}} cm × {{6}} cm. Part B is {{4}} cm × __ cm. Find the missing dimension."

7. **Multiple Decomposition Methods**: Show that the same figure can be decomposed different ways but yield the same area. "Decompose this figure into rectangles in two different ways. Show that both give the same total area." Verify understanding that area is independent of decomposition.

8. **Real-World Composite Areas**: Floor plans, building footprints, or land plots. "A house has an L-shaped floor plan. The main section is {{12}} m × {{8}} m, and the extension is {{4}} m × {{3}} m. What is the total floor area?" Include contexts like rooms, gardens, or painting walls.

Use clear SVG diagrams with dimensions labeled. Mark right angles to show rectangular sections. For missing dimensions, use dashed lines or letters ($x$, $y$). Include grid backgrounds where helpful (each square = {{1}} cm²).

Present formulas:
- Rectangle: $A = l \times w$
- Triangle: $A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$
- Parallelogram: $A = b \times h$

Encourage students to show decomposition strategy and partial calculations. Vary whether students add areas or subtract areas. Ensure all necessary dimensions can be determined from given information.
