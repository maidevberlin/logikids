# Area

Generate a task where {{name}} calculates or compares areas using unit squares and basic formulas appropriate for grade {{grade}} students (ages {{age}}).

Focus on understanding area as covering a surface with unit squares (cm²) and calculating areas of rectangles.

Use varied approaches:

**Counting Unit Squares:**
- Present shapes on grid paper where students count squares
- Example: "This shape on grid paper is made up of unit squares. Count the squares to find the area."
- Use irregular shapes made of whole squares (L-shapes, T-shapes, etc.)
- Vary the number of squares: $12$ cm², $18$ cm², $25$ cm²

**Rectangle Area Formula:**
- Apply the formula: Area $=$ length $\times$ width
- Example: "A rectangle is $7$ cm long and $5$ cm wide. What is its area?"
- Calculation: $7 \times 5 = 35$ cm²
- Use different dimensions: $6 \times 4$, $8 \times 3$, $9 \times 7$

**Square Areas:**
- Calculate areas of squares (special rectangles)
- Example: "A square has sides of $6$ cm. What is its area?"
- Calculation: $6 \times 6 = 36$ cm²

**Comparing Areas:**
- Compare areas of different shapes
- Example: "Rectangle A is $8$ cm by $3$ cm. Rectangle B is $6$ cm by $4$ cm. Which has the larger area?"
- A: $8 \times 3 = 24$ cm²; B: $6 \times 4 = 24$ cm² (same area!)

**Finding Missing Dimensions:**
- Given area and one dimension, find the other
- Example: "A rectangle has an area of $42$ cm² and a width of $6$ cm. How long is it?"
- Calculation: $42 \div 6 = 7$ cm

**Composite Shapes:**
- Find areas of shapes made from multiple rectangles
- Example: "This L-shaped garden can be divided into two rectangles: one is $5$ m by $3$ m and the other is $4$ m by $2$ m. What is the total area?"
- Calculation: $(5 \times 3) + (4 \times 2) = 15 + 8 = 23$ m²

**Real-World Contexts:**
- Apply area to practical situations
- Example: "A rectangular rug is $3$ meters long and $2$ meters wide. What is its area in square meters?"
- Contexts: gardens, rooms, playgrounds, posters, tables

**Grid-Based Shapes:**
- Use coordinate grids to describe shapes and find areas
- Example: "On grid paper, a rectangle has corners at $(1,1)$, $(7,1)$, $(7,4)$, and $(1,4)$. What is its area?"
- Length: $7-1 = 6$ units; Width: $4-1 = 3$ units; Area: $18$ square units

**Unit Conversion Awareness:**
- Work with different units (cm², m²)
- Example: "A square playground has sides of $10$ meters. What is its area in square meters?"

Use tables to organize information:

| Shape | Length | Width | Area |
|-------|--------|-------|------|
| Rectangle A | $5$ cm | $4$ cm | $?$ |
| Rectangle B | $6$ cm | $3$ cm | $?$ |

Include diagrams or grid descriptions when helpful. Use LaTeX for all measurements and calculations. Keep examples concrete and relatable to 8-9 year olds' experiences.
