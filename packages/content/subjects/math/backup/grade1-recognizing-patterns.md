# Recognizing Patterns Tasks

Create problems that help students identify, describe, continue, and create number and shape patterns.

**Vary the problem structure:**

1. **Simple Number Sequences (Counting):**
   - Continue counting forward: "${{start}}, {{next}}, {{after}}, \ldots$ What comes next?"
   - Continue counting backward: "${{start}}, {{down1}}, {{down2}}, \ldots$ What comes next?"
   - Fill in missing numbers: "${{num1}}, \text{?}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}$"

2. **Skip Counting Patterns:**
   - Count by 2s: "$2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots$ Continue the pattern"
   - Count by 5s: "$5, 10, 15, \ldots$ What are the next two numbers?"
   - Count by 10s: "$10, 20, 30, \ldots$ Fill in the blank: $\text{?}, 50, 60$"

3. **Repeating Patterns (AB, ABB, ABC):**
   - Simple AB pattern: "Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, ____ (colors/shapes)"
   - ABB pattern: "Circle, Square, Square, Circle, Square, Square, Circle, ____"
   - ABC pattern: "Star, Heart, Moon, Star, Heart, Moon, ____"

4. **Growing Patterns:**
   - Add the same amount: "$1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots$ (adding $2$ each time)"
   - Patterns in a table:

   | Step | Number of dots |
   |------|----------------|
   | 1    | ${{val1}}$     |
   | 2    | ${{val2}}$     |
   | 3    | ${{val3}}$     |
   | 4    | ?              |

5. **Finding the Pattern Rule:**
   - Describe the rule: "Look at this pattern: ${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}$. What is the rule?"
   - Multiple patterns: "Which pattern follows the rule 'count by {{step}}'?"
   - Pattern comparison: "How are these patterns the same? How are they different?"

6. **Missing Elements in Patterns:**
   - Find multiple missing numbers: "$2, \text{?}, 6, 8, \text{?}, 12$"
   - Pattern with gaps: "${{start}}, {{gap}}, {{gap}}, {{num}}, \text{?}, {{num}}$"
   - Which doesn't belong: "$2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10$ - Which number breaks the pattern?"

7. **Creating Own Patterns:**
   - Create a pattern starting with a given number: "Make a pattern that starts with ${{num}}$"
   - Pattern from a rule: "Create a pattern using the rule: count by ${{step}}$ starting at ${{start}}$"
   - Draw and extend: "Draw a pattern with shapes. What comes next?"

8. **Real-World Pattern Applications:**
   - Calendar patterns: "The days of the week repeat. If Monday is the 1st, what day is the 8th?"
   - Object arrangements: "Plates are arranged: big, small, big, small. The next plate is ____?"
   - Music/rhythm: "Clap, clap, snap, clap, clap, snap. What comes next?"
