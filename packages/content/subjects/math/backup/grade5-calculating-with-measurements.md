# Calculating with Measurements Tasks

Create multi-step word problems involving measurements across different units (length, mass, volume, time, money). Students must convert between units and perform calculations to solve practical problems. Focus on real-world applications requiring mathematical reasoning.

**Vary the measurement types:**
- **Vary using length:** Convert between mm, cm, m, km and calculate distances: $2.5km + 750m = 2500m + 750m = 3250m = 3.25km$
- **Vary using mass:** Convert between g, kg, t and calculate weights: $1.2kg + 450g = 1200g + 450g = 1650g = 1.65kg$
- **Vary using volume:** Convert between ml, l and calculate capacities: $2.5L - 350ml = 2500ml - 350ml = 2150ml = 2.15L$
- **Vary using time:** Convert between seconds, minutes, hours: $2h \, 30min + 45min = 2h \, 75min = 3h \, 15min$
- **Vary using money:** Multi-step price calculations with conversions: $3 \times 4.50€ + 2 \times 2.25€ = 13.50€ + 4.50€ = 18.00€$
- **Vary using area:** Calculate using $m^2$, $cm^2$: Rectangle area $5m \times 3m = 15m^2$

**Vary the conversion complexity:**
- **Vary single-step conversions:** $5km = ?m$ → $5 \times 1000 = 5000m$
- **Vary multi-step conversions:** $2km \, 450m = ?m$ → $2000m + 450m = 2450m$
- **Vary mixed operations:** Add/subtract different units: $3.5kg - 250g = 3500g - 250g = 3250g = 3.25kg$
- **Vary decimal conversions:** $0.75L = ?ml$ → $0.75 \times 1000 = 750ml$
- **Vary fraction conversions:** $\frac{1}{2}km = ?m$ → $1000 \div 2 = 500m$

**Vary the calculation types:**
- **Vary using addition:** "A recipe needs 1.5L milk and 750ml cream. Total liquid?" Use $1.5L + 0.75L = 2.25L$
- **Vary using subtraction:** "A 5kg bag of rice. You use 1.8kg. How much left?" Use $5kg - 1.8kg = 3.2kg$
- **Vary using multiplication:** "One package weighs 0.45kg. What do 12 packages weigh?" Use $0.45kg \times 12 = 5.4kg$
- **Vary using division:** "8.4L of juice fills how many 0.3L glasses?" Use $8.4L \div 0.3L = 28$ glasses
- **Vary using multi-step:** "You drive 2.5km, then 1800m, then 3.2km. Total distance?" Use $2.5km + 1.8km + 3.2km = 7.5km$

**Vary the context:**
- Travel/distance: "You bike 3.2km to school, 1500m to a friend's house, then 2.8km home. Total distance?" Use $3.2km + 1.5km + 2.8km = 7.5km$
- Shopping: "Apples cost $2.80€$/kg. You buy 2.5kg. What's the cost?" Use $2.5 \times 2.80€ = 7.00€$
- Cooking: "A recipe for 4 people needs 600g flour. You're cooking for 10 people. How much flour?" Use $\frac{600g \times 10}{4} = 1500g = 1.5kg$
- Construction: "A fence is 45.8m long. Each panel is 2.3m. How many panels needed?" Use $45.8m \div 2.3m = 20$ panels (approximately)
- Fuel consumption: "Your car uses 6.5L per 100km. How much for 350km?" Use $\frac{350 \times 6.5}{100} = 22.75L$
- Package shipping: "3 packages weigh 1.2kg, 850g, and 2.3kg. Total weight?" Use $1.2kg + 0.85kg + 2.3kg = 4.35kg$
- Garden planning: "A rectangular garden is 8.5m × 6m. What's the area?" Use $8.5m \times 6m = 51m^2$

**Vary the problem complexity:**
- Simple: One conversion + one operation
- Medium: Two conversions or two operations
- Complex: Multiple conversions and operations combined

**Use tables to show:**
- Conversion factor reference charts: $1km = 1000m$, $1kg = 1000g$, $1L = 1000ml$
- Multi-item pricing tables
- Distance/time/speed relationships

**Use LaTeX for all measurements, conversions, and calculations. Show step-by-step solution processes. Create tables for conversion factors and data organization. Include units in all answers.**
