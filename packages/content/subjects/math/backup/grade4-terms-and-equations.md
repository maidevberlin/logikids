# Terms and Equations - Problem Variations

Generate tasks that introduce students to algebraic thinking through simple equations and placeholder problems.

## Variation 1: Addition Equations with One Unknown
Solve the equation by finding the missing value:

$$x + {{b}} = {{result}}$$

What is $x$?

**Example:** $x + 15 = 32$ → $x = 32 - 15 = 17$

## Variation 2: Subtraction Equations
Find the value of the placeholder:

$${{a}} - \Box = {{result}}$$

What number belongs in the box?

**Example:** $45 - \Box = 18$ → $\Box = 45 - 18 = 27$

## Variation 3: Multiplication Equations
Solve for the unknown number:

$${{factor}} \times y = {{product}}$$

What is $y$?

**Example:** $3 \times y = 27$ → $y = 27 \div 3 = 9$

## Variation 4: Division Equations
Find the missing divisor:

$${{dividend}} : \_ = {{quotient}}$$

What number belongs in the blank?

**Example:** $48 : \_ = 6$ → Blank $= 48 \div 6 = 8$

## Variation 5: Two-Step Word Problems
Lisa has ${{initial}}$ euros. She wants to buy {{num_items}} notebooks that each cost the same price. After buying them, she has ${{remaining}}$ euros left. How much does one notebook cost?

**Set up equation:** ${{initial}} - ({{num_items}} \times x) = {{remaining}}$

**Example:** 50€ initial, wants 4 notebooks, 30€ remaining → $50 - (4 \times x) = 30$ → $4 \times x = 20$ → $x = 5€$ per notebook

## Variation 6: Balance Equations
On a balance scale, one side has weights of ${{w1}}$ kg and ${{w2}}$ kg. The other side has one weight of ${{w3}}$ kg and an unknown weight. The scale is balanced. How heavy is the unknown weight?

$${{w1}} + {{w2}} = {{w3}} + x$$

**Example:** $12 + 8 = 15 + x$ → $20 = 15 + x$ → $x = 5$ kg

## Variation 7: Number Riddles with Operations
"I think of a number, multiply it by ${{multiplier}}$, and then add ${{add}}$. The result is ${{result}}$. What number did I think of?"

**Set up:** $(x \times {{multiplier}}) + {{add}} = {{result}}$

**Example:** $(x \times 4) + 7 = 31$ → $x \times 4 = 24$ → $x = 6$

## Variation 8: Missing Numbers in Calculation Chains
Complete the calculation chain by finding the missing number:

$${{start}} \rightarrow +{{step1}} \rightarrow \times \Box \rightarrow = {{end}}$$

**Example:** $5 \rightarrow +10 \rightarrow \times \Box \rightarrow = 60$
First step: $5 + 10 = 15$
Then: $15 \times \Box = 60$ → $\Box = 4$

## Variation 9: Comparison Equations
Tom has ${{a}}$ marbles. Anna has ${{b}}$ more marbles than Tom. Together they have ${{total}}$ marbles. How many marbles does Anna have?

**Set up:** ${{a}} + ({{a}} + {{b}}) = {{total}}$

**Example:** Tom has 12, Anna has $x$ more, together 38 → $12 + (12 + x) = 38$ → $24 + x = 38$ → $x = 14$ more, so Anna has $12 + 14 = 26$ marbles
