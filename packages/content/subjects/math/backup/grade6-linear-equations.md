# Linear Equations

Create diverse problems for solving linear equations using equivalent transformations, including setting up equations from word problems and checking solutions.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Two-Step Equations - Addition/Subtraction First
Solve: ${{coefficient}}x + {{constant1}} = {{constant2}}$

**Show step-by-step solution:**
1. Subtract {{constant1}} from both sides
   $${{coefficient}}x + {{constant1}} - {{constant1}} = {{constant2}} - {{constant1}}$$
   $${{coefficient}}x = ?$$
2. Divide both sides by {{coefficient}}
   $$x = ?$$
3. Check your solution by substituting back into the original equation

**Verification:**
$${{coefficient}} \times (?) + {{constant1}} = {{constant2}}$$

### 2. Two-Step Equations - Multiplication/Division First
Solve: $\frac{x}{{{divisor}}} - {{subtract}} = {{result}}$

**Process:**
1. Add {{subtract}} to both sides
2. Multiply both sides by {{divisor}}
3. Verify the solution

### 3. Equations with Variables on Both Sides
Solve: ${{a}}x + {{b}} = {{c}}x + {{d}}$

**Strategy:**
1. Collect variable terms on one side: subtract {{c}}x from both sides
2. Collect constant terms on the other side
3. Solve for $x$
4. Check the solution

**Show each transformation:**
$${{a}}x + {{b}} = {{c}}x + {{d}}$$
$${{a}}x - {{c}}x + {{b}} = {{d}}$$
$$? = ?$$

### 4. Equations with Parentheses
Solve: ${{multiplier}}(x + {{inner}}) = {{result}}$

**Steps:**
1. Distribute {{multiplier}}: ${{multiplier}} \times x + {{multiplier}} \times {{inner}} = {{result}}$
2. Simplify: ${{multiplier}}x + ? = {{result}}$
3. Subtract the constant term from both sides
4. Divide by the coefficient
5. Verify

### 5. Age Problem
{{person1}} is {{age1}} years old. {{person2}} is {{comparison}} years {{older_younger}} than {{person1}}.

a) Write an equation to represent {{person2}}'s age
b) If {{person1}} will be $x$ years old in {{years_future}} years, how old will {{person2}} be?
c) Set up and solve an equation: In how many years will {{person1}} be {{target_age}} years old?

**Let $x$ represent the unknown quantity.**

### 6. Money Problem
Sarah has {{total}} dollars. She spent {{spent_amount}} dollars on a book and then spent half of her remaining money on lunch. She has {{left}} dollars left.

a) Write an equation to represent this situation
b) Solve for the original amount (verify: {{total}} dollars)
c) How much did lunch cost?

**Set up the equation step by step:**
$$\frac{{{total}} - {{spent_amount}}}{2} = {{left}}$$
No, wait - let's think: Remaining after book = {{total}} - {{spent_amount}}, then half spent...

### 7. Number Problem
Think of a number. Multiply it by {{mult}}, then add {{add}}. The result is {{final}}.

a) Let $x$ be the unknown number. Write an equation
b) Solve for $x$
c) Verify: Does ${{mult}} \times x + {{add}} = {{final}}$?

**Equation:**
$${{mult}}x + {{add}} = {{final}}$$

### 8. Perimeter Problem
A rectangle has length ${{length}}$ cm and width $w$ cm. The perimeter is ${{perimeter}}$ cm.

a) Write an equation using the perimeter formula: $P = 2(l + w)$
b) Substitute known values: ${{perimeter}} = 2({{length}} + w)$
c) Solve for $w$
d) Verify by calculating the perimeter with your answer

**Perimeter formula:**
$$P = 2(l + w) = 2l + 2w$$

### 9. Distribution and Collection
Solve: ${{a}}(x - {{b}}) + {{c}} = {{d}}(x + {{e}})$

**Detailed solution:**
1. Distribute on both sides
   - Left side: ${{a}}(x - {{b}}) = {{a}}x - ?$
   - Right side: ${{d}}(x + {{e}}) = {{d}}x + ?$
2. Rewrite equation: ${{a}}x - ? + {{c}} = {{d}}x + ?$
3. Simplify both sides
4. Collect $x$ terms on one side, constants on the other
5. Solve for $x$

### 10. Mixed Operations with Fractions
Solve: $\frac{{{num}}x + {{const1}}}{{{denom}}} = {{const2}}$

**Strategy:**
1. Multiply both sides by {{denom}} to eliminate the fraction
   $${{num}}x + {{const1}} = {{denom}} \times {{const2}}$$
2. Solve the resulting two-step equation
3. Check: substitute your answer back

### 11. Real-World Application - Distance
A car travels at {{speed}} km/h. After traveling for $x$ hours, the car has covered {{distance}} km.

a) Write an equation using: distance = speed × time
b) Solve for $x$ (the time in hours)
c) If the car continues at the same speed for {{additional}} more hours, what is the total distance traveled?

**Formula:**
$$d = rt$$
where $d$ = distance, $r$ = rate (speed), $t$ = time

### 12. Consecutive Numbers Problem
The sum of three consecutive numbers is {{sum}}.

a) Let $x$ be the first number. Write expressions for the second and third numbers
b) Write an equation for their sum
c) Solve for $x$
d) What are the three consecutive numbers?
e) Verify that their sum equals {{sum}}

**Equation setup:**
If first number is $x$, then:
- Second number: $x + 1$
- Third number: $x + 2$
- Sum: $x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = {{sum}}$

## Task Requirements
- Include a variety of equation types (two-step, variables on both sides, with parentheses)
- Provide at least 2-3 word problems requiring students to set up equations
- Always require students to check their solutions
- Show equivalent transformations clearly at each step
- Use varied coefficients and constants (including negative numbers)
- Include at least one real-world context (age, money, distance, perimeter)
- Emphasize the "balance" concept: what you do to one side, do to the other
- Ensure significantly different numerical values across task generations
