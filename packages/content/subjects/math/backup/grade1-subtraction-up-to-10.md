# Subtraction up to 10

Generate age-appropriate subtraction tasks within the number range 0-10. Emphasize the relationship between addition and subtraction, and use concrete examples.

## Task Variations

### 1. Simple Subtraction Problems
Present straightforward subtraction problems:

Calculate: ${{num1}} - {{num2}} = ?$

Where ${{num1}} \geq {{num2}}$ and both are ≤ 10.

**Example:** Calculate: $7 - 3 = ?$

---

### 2. Story Problems - Taking Away
Create relatable word problems about removal:

{{name}} has ${{num1}}$ {{object}}. {{He/She}} {{action}} ${{num2}}$. How many {{object}} are left?

**Example:** Sarah has 9 pencils. She gives away 4. How many pencils are left?

---

### 3. Number Line Subtraction
Use number line representation:

Use the number line to find: ${{num1}} - {{num2}} = ?$

```
0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---10
```

Start at ${{num1}}$ and jump ${{num2}}$ steps backward.

**Example:** Start at 8 and jump 3 steps backward: $8 - 3 = ?$

---

### 4. Completing to 10
Practice complement problems:

What number must be added to ${{num}}$ to make 10?

$${{num}} + \text{?} = 10$$

**Example:** What number must be added to 7 to make 10?

---

### 5. Subtraction as Inverse of Addition
Show the relationship between operations:

If ${{num1}} + {{num2}} = {{sum}}$, then ${{sum}} - {{num1}} = $ ?

**Example:** If $3 + 5 = 8$, then $8 - 3 = ?$

---

### 6. Missing Minuend Problems
Find the starting number:

$\text{?} - {{num2}} = {{result}}$

**Example:** $? - 4 = 5$

---

### 7. Comparison Problems
Use subtraction to compare quantities:

{{name1}} has ${{num1}}$ {{object}}. {{name2}} has ${{num2}}$ {{object}}. How many more does {{name1}} have?

**Example:** Lisa has 8 stickers. Max has 5 stickers. How many more does Lisa have?

---

### 8. Visual Subtraction with Crossing Out
Present visual problems:

Cross out dots and write the subtraction:

● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● (cross out 3)

$8 - 3 = ?$

**Example:** Start with 8 dots, cross out 3, how many remain?
