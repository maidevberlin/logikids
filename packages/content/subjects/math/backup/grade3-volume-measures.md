# Volume Measures

Generate tasks that teach students about milliliters (ml) and liters (l), including measurement, estimation, and conversion between units.

## Task Variations

### 1. Understanding Liters and Milliliters
Introduce the relationship between units:
- **Basic Conversion**: "How many milliliters are in {{liters}} liter(s)?"
- **Reverse Conversion**: "{{milliliters}} ml = ___ liters and ___ ml"
- **Fact Application**: "Complete: 1 liter = ___ milliliters"

Key relationship: $1 \text{ l} = 1000 \text{ ml}$

Examples:
- $3 \text{ l} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \text{ ml}$
- $2500 \text{ ml} = 2 \text{ l } 500 \text{ ml}$
- $1 \text{ l } 750 \text{ ml} = 1750 \text{ ml}$

### 2. Converting Between Units
Practice unit conversions:
- **Liters to Milliliters**: "{{liters}} l {{ml}} ml = ___ ml total"
- **Milliliters to Liters**: "{{total_ml}} ml = ___ l ___ ml"
- **Mixed Conversions**: "{{value}} {{unit1}} = ___ {{unit2}}"

Conversion table:
| Liters | Milliliters |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 l    | 1000 ml     |
| 0.5 l  | 500 ml      |
| 0.25 l | 250 ml      |
| 2.5 l  | 2500 ml     |

### 3. Adding Volumes
Combine different volume measurements:
- **Same Units**: "{{vol1}} ml + {{vol2}} ml = ___ ml"
- **Mixed Units**: "{{liters}} l + {{ml}} ml = ___ l ___ ml"
- **Multiple Items**: "Bottle A: {{v1}}, Bottle B: {{v2}}, Bottle C: {{v3}}. Total volume?"

Examples:
- $750 \text{ ml} + 500 \text{ ml} = 1250 \text{ ml} = 1 \text{ l } 250 \text{ ml}$
- $2 \text{ l } 300 \text{ ml} + 1 \text{ l } 800 \text{ ml} = 4 \text{ l } 100 \text{ ml}$

### 4. Subtracting Volumes
Find differences between volumes:
- **Simple Subtraction**: "{{larger_vol}} ml - {{smaller_vol}} ml = ___ ml"
- **Mixed Units**: "{{liters}} l - {{ml}} ml = ___ l ___ ml"
- **Remaining Amount**: "Container has {{total}}. You use {{used}}. How much is left?"

Examples:
- $3 \text{ l} - 750 \text{ ml} = 3000 \text{ ml} - 750 \text{ ml} = 2250 \text{ ml} = 2 \text{ l } 250 \text{ ml}$

### 5. Comparing Volumes
Determine which is larger or smaller:
- **Two Volumes**: "Which is more: {{vol1}} {{unit1}} or {{vol2}} {{unit2}}?"
- **Ordering**: "Put these in order from smallest to largest: {{v1}}, {{v2}}, {{v3}}, {{v4}}"
- **How Much More**: "How much more is {{larger}} than {{smaller}}?"

Examples:
- Compare: 1500 ml vs. 1 l 600 ml → $1 \text{ l } 600 \text{ ml} = 1600 \text{ ml}$ (larger)
- Order: 0.5 l, 750 ml, 1 l, 250 ml → 250 ml, 0.5 l, 750 ml, 1 l

### 6. Estimation Problems
Estimate realistic volumes:
- **Common Items**: "Which is the best estimate for a {{item}}: {{opt1}}, {{opt2}}, or {{opt3}}?"
- **Reasonableness**: "Is {{volume}} a reasonable amount for a {{container}}?"

Common volumes to estimate:
- Spoon: 5-15 ml
- Glass: 200-300 ml
- Water bottle: 500 ml - 1 l
- Milk carton: 1 l
- Bucket: 5-10 l
- Bathtub: 100-200 l

### 7. Filling and Pouring
Solve practical container problems:
- **How Many Containers**: "Small bottle: {{small_vol}}. Large container: {{large_vol}}. How many small bottles fill the large one?"
- **Filling Partially**: "Container holds {{capacity}}. It's {{fraction}} full. How much liquid is in it?"
- **Pouring Between**: "Pour {{amount}} from Container A ({{total_a}}) to Container B ({{total_b}}). How much in each now?"

Examples:
- Small: 250 ml, Large: 2 l → $2000 \div 250 = 8$ bottles
- Capacity: 3 l, Half full → $3000 \div 2 = 1500$ ml = 1 l 500 ml

### 8. Word Problems with Volume
Apply volume skills to real scenarios:
- **Recipes**: "Recipe needs {{vol1}} milk and {{vol2}} water. Total liquid?"
- **Shopping**: "Buy {{num}} bottles of {{vol}} each. How many liters total?"
- **Medicine**: "Take {{dose}} three times daily. How much in one day? One week?"

Example:
- Recipe: 500 ml milk + 300 ml water = 800 ml liquid
- Shopping: 6 bottles × 1.5 l = 9 l total
- Medicine: 5 ml × 3 = 15 ml/day; 15 ml × 7 = 105 ml/week

## Answer Requirements

Provide solutions that:
- Show conversion calculations explicitly ($\times 1000$ or $\div 1000$)
- Express answers in appropriate units (simplify to liters and ml)
- Include diagrams of containers when helpful
- Use tables to organize multi-step problems
- Explain estimation reasoning for realistic contexts
- Provide both exact calculations and practical interpretations
