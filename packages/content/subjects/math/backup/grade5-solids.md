# Solids

Create tasks where {{child_name}} works with 3D solids, their representations, and nets appropriate for grade 5 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Identifying Solids**: Present oblique views or descriptions and ask to identify the solid (cube, rectangular prism, triangular prism, cylinder, cone, sphere, pyramid). "What solid has {{6 rectangular faces}}?" or show an SVG oblique view.

2. **Properties of Solids**: Count and identify faces, edges, and vertices. "How many {{edges}} does a {{rectangular prism}} have?" or "A {{cube}} has __ faces, __ edges, and __ vertices." Vary the solid and which property to find.

3. **Drawing Oblique Views**: Provide dimensions and ask students to describe or sketch an oblique (3D) view of a solid. For a cube with edge {{5}} cm or rectangular prism {{length 6 cm, width 4 cm, height 3 cm}}. Can describe the view or provide a template to complete.

4. **Matching Nets to Solids**: Show {{2-4}} nets and ask which one(s) will fold to make a specific solid (cube, rectangular prism, triangular prism). Include some incorrect nets that are close but won't work. Use simple SVG representations.

5. **Creating Nets**: Ask students to describe or design a net for a given solid. "Draw/describe a net for a cube with edge length {{6}} cm" or "Create a net for a rectangular prism with dimensions {{length 8 cm, width 5 cm, height 3 cm}}."

6. **Building from Views**: Provide different views (front, side, top) and ask what solid they represent or how many cubes are needed to build it. Use simple cube constructions ({{3-8}} cubes).

7. **Comparing Solids**: Compare properties of different solids. "Which has more faces: a {{triangular prism}} or a {{rectangular prism}}?" or "What do a {{cylinder}} and a {{cone}} have in common?"

8. **Real-World Applications**: Identify solids in real contexts. "A soup can is shaped like a __" or "A gift box is a rectangular prism. If you unfold it, what shape is the net?" Include packaging and building contexts.

Use SVG diagrams to show oblique views and nets clearly. For oblique views, show visible edges as solid lines and hidden edges as dashed lines. Common solids: cube (all edges equal), rectangular prism (box shape), triangular prism, cylinder, cone, square pyramid, sphere. Emphasize visualization skills and spatial reasoning. Include both identification and construction tasks.
