# Fraction Addition and Subtraction

Create diverse problems for adding and subtracting fractions, including like fractions, unlike fractions, and mixed numbers with real-world contexts.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Like Fractions - Basic Addition
Calculate: $\frac{{{numerator1}}}{{{denominator}}} + \frac{{{numerator2}}}{{{denominator}}}$

**Explain:** When fractions have the same denominator, add the numerators and keep the denominator the same.

$$\frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c} = \frac{a + b}{c}$$

Simplify the result if possible.

### 2. Unlike Fractions - Finding Common Denominator
Calculate: $\frac{{{num1}}}{{{denom1}}} + \frac{{{num2}}}{{{denom2}}}$

**Show the process:**
1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of {{denom1}} and {{denom2}}
2. Convert both fractions to equivalent fractions with the common denominator
3. Add the numerators
4. Simplify if possible

**Example table for finding equivalent fractions:**

| Original Fraction | Common Denominator | Equivalent Fraction |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| $\frac{{{num1}}}{{{denom1}}}$ | | |
| $\frac{{{num2}}}{{{denom2}}}$ | | |

### 3. Recipe Problem - Adding Fractions
A cookie recipe needs $\frac{{{cups1}}}{{{denom1}}}$ cups of flour and a cake recipe needs $\frac{{{cups2}}}{{{denom2}}}$ cups of flour.
a) How many cups of flour are needed in total?
b) If you have ${{total_available}}$ cups of flour, is that enough?
c) How much flour will be left over (or how much more is needed)?

Express all answers as simplified fractions or mixed numbers.

### 4. Subtraction with Unlike Denominators
Calculate: $\frac{{{num3}}}{{{denom3}}} - \frac{{{num4}}}{{{denom4}}}$

**Show step-by-step:**
1. Find the LCM of {{denom3}} and {{denom4}}
2. Convert to equivalent fractions
3. Subtract the numerators
4. Simplify the result

### 5. Mixed Numbers Addition
Calculate: ${{whole1}}\frac{{{frac_num1}}}{{{frac_denom1}}} + {{whole2}}\frac{{{frac_num2}}}{{{frac_denom2}}}$

**Method 1 (Add whole numbers and fractions separately):**
- Add whole numbers: ${{whole1}} + {{whole2}}$
- Add fractions: $\frac{{{frac_num1}}}{{{frac_denom1}}} + \frac{{{frac_num2}}}{{{frac_denom2}}}$
- Combine results

**Method 2 (Convert to improper fractions):**
- Convert both to improper fractions
- Find common denominator and add
- Convert back to mixed number

### 6. Mixed Numbers Subtraction
Anna had ${{whole_a}}\frac{{{frac_a}}}{{{denom_a}}}$ meters of ribbon. She used ${{whole_b}}\frac{{{frac_b}}}{{{denom_b}}}$ meters for a craft project.
a) How much ribbon does she have left?
b) If she needs ${{needed}}$ meters total for another project, does she have enough?

Show your work using either method (whole numbers separately or improper fractions).

### 7. Three Fractions - Chain Operations
Calculate: $\frac{{{n1}}}{{{d1}}} + \frac{{{n2}}}{{{d2}}} - \frac{{{n3}}}{{{d3}}}$

**Process:**
1. Find the LCM of all three denominators: {{d1}}, {{d2}}, {{d3}}
2. Convert all fractions to the common denominator
3. Perform the operations from left to right
4. Simplify the final answer

### 8. Word Problem - Paint Mixing
A painter mixed different amounts of paint:
- Blue paint: $\frac{{{blue_num}}}{{{blue_denom}}}$ liters
- Yellow paint: $\frac{{{yellow_num}}}{{{yellow_denom}}}$ liters
- Red paint: $\frac{{{red_num}}}{{{red_denom}}}$ liters

a) How much blue and yellow paint combined?
b) How much more blue paint than red paint?
c) What is the total amount of all three colors?

**Present answers in a table:**

| Calculation | Expression | Answer |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Blue + Yellow | | |
| Blue - Red | | |
| Total all colors | | |

### 9. Distance Problem
Tom walked ${{dist1}}\frac{{{frac1}}}{{{fdenom1}}}$ km in the morning and ${{dist2}}\frac{{{frac2}}}{{{fdenom2}}}$ km in the afternoon.
a) How far did he walk in total?
b) How much farther did he walk in the {{compare_period}}?
c) His goal was to walk ${{goal}}$ km. Did he reach his goal? By how much did he exceed or fall short?

### 10. Comparison and Ordering
Given these fractions: $\frac{{{a}}}{{{b}}}$, $\frac{{{c}}}{{{d}}}$, $\frac{{{e}}}{{{f}}}$

a) Convert all fractions to a common denominator
b) Order them from smallest to largest
c) Find the difference between the largest and smallest fraction
d) Find the sum of all three fractions

## Task Requirements
- Include a mix of like and unlike fractions
- Use denominators between 2 and 12
- Include at least one mixed number problem
- Provide at least one real-world context (cooking, measuring, distance, etc.)
- Show both methods for mixed numbers when appropriate
- Always simplify final answers
- Ensure varied numerical values across different task generations
