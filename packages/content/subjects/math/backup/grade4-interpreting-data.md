# Interpreting Data

Generate tasks where students analyze and interpret various types of data representations including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables. Focus on critical thinking about how data is presented and what conclusions can be drawn.

## Variation Guidelines

Create diverse tasks using these approaches:

1. **Bar Chart Analysis**: Present a bar chart showing {{data_context}} with {{number_range}} data points. Ask students to read specific values, compare categories, find the {{comparison_type}}, and draw conclusions. Use contexts like class surveys, school cafeteria preferences, or library book checkouts.

2. **Line Graph Interpretation**: Show a line graph displaying {{trend_data}} over {{time_period}}. Students identify trends, predict future values, find maximum/minimum points, and explain what the graph shows. Examples: temperature over a week, plant growth over months, or savings account balance.

3. **Pie Chart Reading**: Present a pie chart showing {{category_distribution}} with {{number_of_sections}} sections. Ask students to determine which category is largest/smallest, estimate percentages, or calculate actual numbers if the total is given (e.g., "If 120 students were surveyed...").

4. **Table Data Analysis**: Provide a table with {{rows}} rows and {{columns}} columns containing {{data_type}}. Students answer questions requiring them to find specific values, calculate totals or differences, and identify patterns. Use contexts like sports scores, class test results, or weather data.

5. **Comparing Representations**: Show the same data in two different formats (bar chart and table, or pie chart and bar chart). Ask students to explain advantages of each representation and which is better for answering specific questions.

6. **Critical Analysis**: Present a misleading graph (broken axis, inconsistent scales, 3D effects, or cherry-picked time ranges). Ask students to identify what makes the graph misleading and how it could be improved. Use age-appropriate contexts like comparing allowances or video game scores.

7. **Survey Design**: Describe a question someone wants to answer (e.g., "What are the most popular hobbies in our class?"). Students design a simple survey, suggest how to collect data, and propose the best way to display results.

8. **Multi-Step Analysis**: Provide a more complex dataset (e.g., favorite fruits of two different classes) and ask students to create a representation, compare groups, and explain their findings. This combines reading, creating, and interpreting skills.

**Data Contexts**: Use relatable topics like favorite school subjects, pets owned by classmates, time spent on activities, goals scored in soccer games, books read per month, types of transportation to school, favorite ice cream flavors, weather conditions, or recycling collected.

**Vary complexity** by adjusting the number of categories (3-8), the size of numbers (10-200), whether calculations are needed, and how obvious the patterns are.
