# Symmetry

Create tasks where {{child_name}} explores line symmetry and rotational symmetry in shapes and designs appropriate for grade 5 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Identifying Line Symmetry**: Show shapes or designs and ask how many lines of symmetry they have. Use regular polygons (triangle: {{3}}, square: {{4}}, pentagon: {{5}}, hexagon: {{6}}), letters (A, H, M, T, etc.), and simple designs. Include shapes with {{0, 1, 2, or more}} lines.

2. **Drawing Lines of Symmetry**: Present an SVG shape and ask students to identify and draw all lines of symmetry. Use squares, rectangles, rhombuses, regular polygons, or simple symmetric designs. Vary complexity from {{1-6}} lines of symmetry.

3. **Completing Symmetric Figures**: Provide half a figure and a line of symmetry. Ask students to complete the figure to make it symmetric. Use grid paper representations where students can mirror the given half across a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal axis.

4. **Rotational Symmetry Introduction**: Ask whether a shape has rotational symmetry and what order. "Does a {{square}} have rotational symmetry? At what angles?" Common orders: square ({{90°, 180°, 270°}}), equilateral triangle ({{120°, 240°}}), regular hexagon ({{60°, 120°, 180°, etc.}}).

5. **Comparing Symmetries**: Compare line vs. rotational symmetry. "A {{rectangle}} has {{2}} lines of symmetry and rotational symmetry of order {{2}}. Does a {{rhombus}} have the same symmetries?" Include shapes where these differ.

6. **Symmetry in Letters and Numbers**: Identify which letters or numbers have vertical symmetry (A, H, M, T, U, V, W, X, Y), horizontal symmetry (B, C, D, E, H, I, K, O, X), or rotational symmetry (H, I, N, O, S, X, Z). Vary the set provided.

7. **Creating Symmetric Designs**: Ask students to create a design with specific symmetry properties. "Design a pattern with {{2}} lines of symmetry" or "Create a shape with {{rotational symmetry of order 4}}." Can use grid paper or describe the design.

8. **Real-World Symmetry**: Identify symmetry in real objects or images. "How many lines of symmetry does a {{butterfly/snowflake/stop sign}} have?" or "Does the {{recycling symbol}} have rotational symmetry?" Use familiar objects and symbols.

Use SVG diagrams or grid representations. For line symmetry, clearly show the axis/axes. For rotational symmetry, indicate the center of rotation. Common shapes: equilateral triangle (3 lines, order 3), square (4 lines, order 4), rectangle (2 lines, order 2), circle (infinite lines, continuous rotation). Emphasize both recognition and creation of symmetric figures.
