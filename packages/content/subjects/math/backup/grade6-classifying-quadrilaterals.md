# Classifying Quadrilaterals

Create tasks where {{child_name}} classifies quadrilaterals and understands their hierarchical relationships appropriate for grade 6 (ages {{age}}).

## Task Variations

1. **Identifying by Properties**: Give a set of properties and ask which quadrilateral(s) fit. "Which quadrilateral has {{all sides equal and all angles equal}}?" Possible answers: square. Or "{{opposite sides parallel and all sides equal}}?" Answers: square, rhombus. Vary the property combinations.

2. **Hierarchical Relationships**: True/false or explanation questions about subset relationships. "True or false: All {{squares}} are {{rectangles}}?" or "Is every {{rhombus}} also a {{parallelogram}}? Explain." Test understanding that properties are inherited (e.g., square → rectangle → parallelogram).

3. **The Quadrilateral Family Tree**: Present or ask students to create a hierarchy diagram showing relationships. At bottom: general quadrilateral. Next level: trapezoid, parallelogram, kite. Further up: rectangle, rhombus. Top: square. Ask questions about the hierarchy.

4. **Properties Comparison Tables**: Complete tables comparing properties across quadrilaterals:

| Quadrilateral | Opposite Sides Parallel | All Sides Equal | All Angles Equal | Diagonals Bisect Each Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Square | {{Yes}} | {{Yes}} | {{Yes}} | {{Yes}} |
| Rectangle | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Rhombus | ? | ? | ? | ? |

Vary which cells are filled and which students must complete.

5. **Special Quadrilaterals**: Focus on rhombus ({{all sides equal, opposite angles equal}}), kite ({{2 pairs adjacent sides equal, 1 pair opposite angles equal}}), trapezoid ({{at least one pair parallel sides}}), isosceles trapezoid ({{parallel sides and equal legs}}). Ask to identify from diagrams or descriptions.

6. **Diagonal Properties**: Compare diagonal properties. "Which quadrilaterals have diagonals that {{bisect each other}}?" (parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square). "Which have diagonals that are {{perpendicular}}?" (rhombus, square, kite). "Which have diagonals that are {{equal in length}}?" (rectangle, square, isosceles trapezoid).

7. **Multiple Classifications**: Identify all names that apply to a given shape. Show a square and ask: "This shape is a square. What other quadrilateral names also apply to it?" Expected: rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, trapezoid, quadrilateral. Tests comprehensive understanding of hierarchy.

8. **Reasoning and Proof**: Justify statements. "Explain why all {{rectangles}} have {{diagonals of equal length}}." or "If a quadrilateral has {{all sides equal}}, must it be a {{square}}? Why or why not?" (No, could be rhombus.) Encourage logical reasoning.

Use clear SVG diagrams showing each quadrilateral type with key properties highlighted (equal sides marked, parallel sides indicated with arrows, right angles marked). Include the "house of quadrilaterals" hierarchy diagram. Emphasize that:
- Square is most specific (all properties)
- Parallelogram is middle (opposite sides parallel)
- Quadrilateral is most general (4 sides)

Properties to compare: parallel sides, equal sides, right angles, diagonal relationships (bisect, perpendicular, equal length).
