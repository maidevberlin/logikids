# Proportional Relationships Tasks

Create problems that help students recognize and work with proportional relationships where quantities increase or decrease together. The relationship follows $y = m \times x$ where $m$ is the constant of proportionality.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Vary price problems:** "{{quantity1}} kg of {{item}} cost {{price1}}€. How much do {{quantity2}} kg cost?" Use the rule of three: $\frac{x_1}{y_1} = \frac{x_2}{y_2}$
- **Vary speed and distance:** "A car travels {{distance1}} km in {{time1}} hours. How far does it travel in {{time2}} hours at the same speed?" where $d = v \times t$
- **Vary recipe scaling:** "A recipe for {{servings1}} people needs {{amount1}} g of {{ingredient}}. How much is needed for {{servings2}} people?"
- **Vary unit rate problems:** "{{quantity}} items cost {{price}}€. What is the price per item? How much do {{newQuantity}} items cost?"
- **Vary table and graph creation:** Provide a proportional relationship and ask students to create a value table and graph showing $y = mx$ as a line through the origin

**Vary the numbers:**
- For beginners: Simple whole numbers with obvious ratios (2:4, 3:6, 5:10)
- For intermediate: Larger numbers requiring calculation (7:21, 12:36, 15:45)
- For advanced: Decimal numbers (2.5:7.5, 3.2:9.6) and fractions ($\frac{1}{2}$:$\frac{3}{2}$)

**Vary the context:**
- Shopping scenarios: fruits, vegetables, school supplies, books
- Travel scenarios: constant speed journeys, fuel consumption ($l$ per $100$ km)
- Recipe scenarios: ingredients scaling up or down, serving size adjustments
- Currency exchange: converting between currencies at a fixed rate
- Work scenarios: earnings per hour, pages read per minute, items produced per day

**Vary the question type:**
- Direct calculation using rule of three: Find unknown value given proportional relationship
- Finding the constant: "What is the price per kilogram?" or "What is the speed?" Calculate $m = \frac{y}{x}$
- Creating tables: Given one pair, create a table with at least 5 value pairs
- Graphing: Plot points and verify they form a straight line through origin
- Writing equations: Express the relationship as $y = m \times x$ with specific value for $m$
- Recognition: Determine if given data shows proportional relationship by checking if $\frac{y}{x}$ is constant

**Graph and table integration:**

Example table for $y = 2.5x$ (price of apples at 2.50€/kg):

| Mass (kg) | Price (€) |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1         | 2.50      |
| 2         | 5.00      |
| 3         | 7.50      |
| 4         | 10.00     |
| 5         | 12.50     |

Students should recognize:
- The ratio $\frac{\text{Price}}{\text{Mass}}$ is always $2.5$
- The graph is a straight line through $(0, 0)$
- The equation is $p = 2.5 \times m$

**Multiple representations:**
- **Verbal:** "Apples cost 2.50€ per kilogram"
- **Table:** Show value pairs as above
- **Graph:** Line through origin with slope $m = 2.5$
- **Equation:** $y = 2.5x$ or $p = 2.5m$
- **Rule of three:** $\frac{p_1}{m_1} = \frac{p_2}{m_2}$

**Comparison with non-proportional relationships:**
- Present scenarios and ask: "Is this proportional?" Include:
  - Price per kg (proportional: $y = mx$)
  - Taxi fare with base fee (not proportional: $y = mx + b$ where $b \neq 0$)
  - Distance at constant speed (proportional: $d = vt$)
  - Age and height (not proportional - no constant ratio)

**Advanced applications:**
- Scale drawings: "A map has scale 1:50000. What real distance does {{mapDistance}} cm represent?"
- Mixing ratios: "A paint mixture uses {{part1}} parts blue and {{part2}} parts yellow. How much blue is needed if you have {{amount}} yellow?"
- Density problems: "Material X has density {{density}} g/cm³. What is the mass of {{volume}} cm³?"

**Use LaTeX for all mathematical expressions and formulas.**
