# Number Range up to 100

Generate tasks that help students understand, read, write, and work with numbers up to 100. Focus on place value understanding and number relationships.

## Task Variations

### 1. Reading and Writing Numbers
Practice number representation:

Write the number **{{number_word}}** as a numeral.

Or reverse:

Write the number ${{num}}$ in words.

**Example:** Write "forty-seven" as a numeral. (Answer: 47)

---

### 2. Place Value - Tens and Ones
Understand place value system:

How many **tens** and **ones** are in ${{num}}$?

$${{num}} = {\text{__ tens}} + {\text{__ ones}}$$

**Example:** How many tens and ones are in 84? (Answer: 8 tens and 4 ones)

---

### 3. Building Numbers from Place Value
Construct numbers from components:

What number has ${{tens}}$ tens and ${{ones}}$ ones?

**Example:** What number has 6 tens and 3 ones? (Answer: 63)

---

### 4. Comparing Numbers
Compare using symbols:

Fill in the correct symbol (>, <, or =):

$${{num1}} \text{ __ } {{num2}}$$

**Example:** $45 \text{ __ } 54$ (Answer: $45 < 54$)

---

### 5. Ordering Numbers
Arrange numbers by size:

Order these numbers from **smallest** to **largest**:

$${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}$$

**Example:** Order: 23, 67, 19, 88

---

### 6. Number Line Positioning
Locate numbers on a number line:

Mark the position of ${{num}}$ on the number line:

```
0----10----20----30----40----50----60----70----80----90----100
```

**Example:** Where does 75 go on the number line?

---

### 7. Skip Counting
Practice counting patterns:

Count by **{{skip_num}}s** from ${{start}}$ to ${{end}}$:

${{start}}$, __, __, __, ${{end}}$

**Examples:**
- Count by 10s: 10, 20, 30, ..., 100
- Count by 5s: 5, 10, 15, ..., 50
- Count by 2s: 2, 4, 6, ..., 20

---

### 8. Expanded Form
Write numbers in expanded notation:

Write ${{num}}$ in expanded form:

$${{num}} = {{tens}} \times 10 + {{ones}} \times 1$$

**Example:** Write 73 in expanded form: $73 = 7 \times 10 + 3 \times 1 = 70 + 3$

---

### 9. Number Patterns
Identify and complete patterns:

Find the pattern and fill in the missing numbers:

${{num1}}$, ${{num2}}$, __, __, ${{num5}}$

**Example:** 15, 25, __, __, 55 (Pattern: +10)

---

### 10. Rounding to Nearest Ten
Introduction to rounding:

Round ${{num}}$ to the nearest ten.

Is ${{num}}$ closer to ${{lower_ten}}$ or ${{upper_ten}}$?

**Example:** Round 47 to the nearest ten. Is it closer to 40 or 50? (Answer: 50)
