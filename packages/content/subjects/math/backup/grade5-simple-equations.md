# Simple Equations

Generate an equation problem appropriate for a {{age}}-year-old student (Grade {{grade}}) at {{difficulty}} difficulty level.

## Problem Variations

### 1. Addition Equations
Solve for $x$: $x + {{a}} = {{b}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $x + 5 = 12$, $x + 8 = 20$, $x + 15 = 30$
- Medium: $x + 17 = 45$, $x + 23 = 67$, $x + 34 = 81$
- Hard: $x + 48 = 125$, $x + 67 = 153$, $x + 89 = 207$

**Solution method:** Subtract {{a}} from both sides.

### 2. Subtraction Equations
Solve for $x$: $x - {{a}} = {{b}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $x - 7 = 10$, $x - 12 = 15$, $x - 9 = 18$
- Medium: $x - 24 = 36$, $x - 35 = 48$, $x - 41 = 59$
- Hard: $x - 58 = 97$, $x - 73 = 126$, $x - 84 = 145$

**Solution method:** Add {{a}} to both sides.

### 3. Multiplication Equations
Solve for $x$: ${{a}} \cdot x = {{b}}$ or ${{a}}x = {{b}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $3x = 15$, $4x = 20$, $5x = 30$
- Medium: $6x = 48$, $7x = 56$, $8x = 72$
- Hard: $9x = 108$, $12x = 144$, $15x = 180$

**Solution method:** Divide both sides by {{a}}.

### 4. Division Equations
Solve for $x$: $x \div {{a}} = {{b}}$ or $\frac{x}{{{a}}} = {{b}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $x \div 3 = 4$, $\frac{x}{5} = 6$, $x \div 4 = 8$
- Medium: $\frac{x}{6} = 9$, $x \div 8 = 7$, $\frac{x}{7} = 12$
- Hard: $x \div 12 = 11$, $\frac{x}{15} = 8$, $x \div 9 = 16$

**Solution method:** Multiply both sides by {{a}}.

### 5. Two-Step Equations (Addition then Multiplication)
Solve for $x$: ${{a}}x + {{b}} = {{c}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $2x + 5 = 13$, $3x + 4 = 19$, $4x + 6 = 22$
- Medium: $5x + 8 = 33$, $6x + 12 = 48$, $7x + 15 = 57$
- Hard: $8x + 20 = 84$, $9x + 27 = 108$, $12x + 18 = 90$

**Solution steps:**
1. Subtract {{b}} from both sides
2. Divide by {{a}}

### 6. Two-Step Equations (Subtraction then Multiplication)
Solve for $x$: ${{a}}x - {{b}} = {{c}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $2x - 3 = 7$, $3x - 5 = 10$, $4x - 8 = 12$
- Medium: $5x - 10 = 25$, $6x - 14 = 28$, $7x - 18 = 38$
- Hard: $8x - 24 = 56$, $9x - 36 = 72$, $10x - 45 = 85$

**Solution steps:**
1. Add {{b}} to both sides
2. Divide by {{a}}

### 7. Equations with Variables on Both Sides (Simple)
Solve for $x$: $x + {{a}} = 2x + {{b}}$ or ${{c}}x + {{d}} = x + {{e}}$

**Example equations:**
- Easy: $x + 10 = 2x + 3$
- Medium: $3x + 8 = 2x + 15$
- Hard: $5x + 12 = 4x + 23$

**Solution steps:**
1. Move all $x$ terms to one side
2. Move constants to the other side
3. Simplify

### 8. Real-World Equation Problems
**Money problem:** Sarah has ${{start}} and saves ${{per_week}} each week. After how many weeks will she have ${{total}}?

**Equation:** ${{start}} + {{per_week}} \cdot x = {{total}}$

**Example problems:**
- Easy: Has $15, saves $5 per week, goal $40
- Medium: Has $25, saves $8 per week, goal $89
- Hard: Has $48, saves $12 per week, goal $144

**Age problem:** Tom is {{age1}} years old. His sister is {{diff}} years older. If the sum of their ages is {{sum}}, how old is Tom's sister?

**Equation:** ${{age1}} + ({{age1}} + {{diff}}) = {{sum}}$

**Example problems:**
- Easy: Tom is 8, sister is 3 years older, sum is 19
- Medium: Tom is 12, sister is 5 years older, sum is 29
- Hard: Tom is 15, sister is 7 years older, sum is 37

## Solution Requirements

Provide:
1. **Step-by-step solution** showing equivalent transformations
2. **Check your answer** by substituting back into the original equation
3. **Clear explanation** of each operation performed
4. **Final answer** in the form: $x = ...$

**Example solution format:**
$$x + 7 = 15$$
$$x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7$$
$$x = 8$$

**Check:** $8 + 7 = 15$ ✓
