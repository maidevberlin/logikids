# Number Concept Development Tasks

Create problems that help students understand numbers from 0 to 20, their relationships, and how to represent them in different ways.

**Vary the problem structure:**

1. **Counting and Number Recognition:**
   - Count the objects and write the number: "There are {{count}} balloons. Write the number."
   - Circle the correct number: "Which number shows {{word}}? Choose from: {{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}"
   - Write the number that comes after/before: "What number comes after ${{num}}$?"

2. **Number Decomposition:**
   - Break apart a number: "Show {{total}} in two groups. ${{total}} = {{part1}} + {{part2}}$"
   - Missing part problems: "${{whole}} = {{part}} + \text{?}$"
   - Multiple decompositions: "Find three different ways to make ${{number}}$"

3. **Number Line Positioning:**
   - Place numbers on a number line from $0$ to $20$
   - Find the missing number: "What number goes in the empty space between ${{num1}}$ and ${{num2}}$?"
   - Jump problems: "Start at ${{start}}$, jump forward ${{jump}}$ spaces. Where do you land?"

4. **Comparing Quantities:**
   - Use comparison symbols: "${{num1}}$ ____ ${{num2}}$ (fill in $>$, $<$, or $=$)"
   - Ordering numbers: "Put these numbers in order from smallest to largest: ${{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, {{num4}}$"
   - Which is more/less: "{{name1}} has ${{count1}}$ stickers, {{name2}} has ${{count2}}$ stickers. Who has more?"

5. **Part-Whole Relationships:**
   - Story problems: "{{name}} has ${{part1}}$ red marbles and ${{part2}}$ blue marbles. How many marbles in total?"
   - Missing addend: "${{part}} + \text{?} = {{whole}}$"
   - Ten-frame visualization: "Show ${{number}}$ on a ten-frame. How many spaces are filled? How many are empty?"

6. **Skip Counting and Patterns:**
   - Count by 2s: "$2, 4, 6, \ldots$ What comes next?"
   - Count by 5s: "$5, 10, 15, \ldots$ Continue the pattern"
   - Count backwards: "$20, 19, 18, \ldots$ What comes next?"

7. **Representing Numbers with Materials:**
   - Draw groups: "Show ${{number}}$ using groups of counters"
   - Tens and ones: "Show ${{number}}$ using tens and ones (for numbers 11-20)"
   - Different representations: "Draw ${{number}}$ using dots, tally marks, or pictures"

8. **Real-World Applications:**
   - Sharing equally: "${{total}}$ cookies shared between ${{people}}$ friends. How many does each get?"
   - Combining groups: "There are ${{group1}}$ birds in one tree and ${{group2}}$ in another. How many birds total?"
   - Finding differences: "{{name}} has ${{num1}}$ toys. {{friend}} has ${{num2}}$ toys. How many more/fewer?"
