# Expanding Money Values Tasks

Create practical money calculation tasks that help students add, subtract, and calculate change using Euros and Cents. Focus on real shopping scenarios where students must combine different denominations and determine correct change.

**Vary the calculation types:**
- **Vary using addition:** "You have 2.50€ and get 1.75€ more. How much money do you have now?" Use $2.50€ + 1.75€ = ?$
- **Vary using subtraction:** "You have 5.00€ and spend 3.25€. How much is left?" Use $5.00€ - 3.25€ = ?$
- **Vary using change calculation:** "You pay with a 10€ bill for something that costs 6.80€. How much change do you get?" Use $10.00€ - 6.80€ = ?$
- **Vary using multiple items:** "An apple costs 0.45€ and a banana costs 0.35€. What is the total?" Use $0.45€ + 0.35€ = ?$
- **Vary using conversion:** "How many cents are in 3.50€?" Use $3.50€ = 350$ cents
- **Vary using comparison:** "You need 8.00€. You have 5.50€. How much more do you need?" Use $8.00€ - 5.50€ = ?$

**Vary the amounts:**
- For ages 7-8: Amounts from 0.10€ to 20.00€
- Use common price endings: .25€, .50€, .75€, .00€
- Include both Euro-only and mixed Euro-Cent amounts
- Vary decimal complexity: 2.00€ (easy) vs. 4.35€ (medium)

**Vary the context:**
- Bakery shopping: "A pretzel costs 1.20€ and a juice costs 1.80€. What's the total?"
- Toy store: "You want a toy for 12.50€. You saved 8.75€. How much more do you need?"
- Pocket money: "You get 5.00€ weekly. After 3 weeks, how much do you have?"
- Market shopping: "Apples cost 2.40€ per kg. You buy 2 kg. What do you pay?"
- Saving goals: "You want to save 15.00€. You have 11.25€. How much more do you need?"

**Vary the payment methods:**
- Paying with exact amount
- Paying with larger bills (5€, 10€, 20€) and calculating change
- Combining different coins and bills: "Show two ways to make 3.50€"
- Finding equivalent amounts: "Is 250 cents the same as 2.50€?"

**Use tables to organize shopping lists with prices and totals. Use LaTeX for all calculations: $€$ symbol and decimal notation. Keep word problems clear and relatable to children's shopping experiences.**
