# Number Range up to 1000

Generate tasks that help students work with three-digit numbers, focusing on place value, comparison, ordering, and rounding.

## Task Variations

### 1. Place Value Decomposition
Present a three-digit number and ask students to break it down:
- **Problem**: "The number {{number}} contains how many hundreds, tens, and ones?"
- **Example**: $527 = 5 \text{ hundreds} + 2 \text{ tens} + 7 \text{ ones}$
- Use diverse numbers: {{number}} could be 318, 742, 605, 890, 463

### 2. Writing Numbers in Different Forms
Ask students to convert between forms:
- **Digits to Words**: "Write {{number}} in words"
- **Words to Digits**: "Write 'six hundred thirty-four' as a number"
- **Expanded Form**: "Write {{number}} as a sum: ___ + ___ + ___"
- Example: $456 = 400 + 50 + 6$

### 3. Rounding Numbers
Practice rounding to tens and hundreds:
- **Round to Tens**: "Round {{number}} to the nearest ten"
- **Round to Hundreds**: "Round {{number}} to the nearest hundred"
- **Double Rounding**: "Round {{number1}} to tens and {{number2}} to hundreds"
- Use numbers like 347 (rounds to 350, 300), 682 (680, 700), 435 (440, 400)

### 4. Number Line Tasks
Work with positioning on a number line:
- **Find Missing**: "Complete: {{start}}, {{step2}}, ___, {{step4}}, {{end}}"
- **Estimate Position**: "Where would {{number}} be on a line from {{min}} to {{max}}?"
- Example: Find the missing number: $320, 340, \_\_\_, 380, 400$ (answer: 360)

### 5. Comparing and Ordering
Compare multiple numbers:
- **Two Numbers**: "Which is larger: {{num1}} or {{num2}}? Explain using place value"
- **Order Series**: "Order from smallest to largest: {{n1}}, {{n2}}, {{n3}}, {{n4}}"
- **Between Numbers**: "Name 3 numbers between {{lower}} and {{upper}}"
- Example: Order 567, 576, 657, 756 (answer: 567, 576, 657, 756)

### 6. Building Numbers
Create numbers with constraints:
- **Largest/Smallest**: "Use digits {{d1}}, {{d2}}, {{d3}} to make the largest possible number"
- **Specific Value**: "Make a number close to {{target}} using digits {{digits}}"
- Example: "Use 3, 7, 2 to make the largest number" (answer: 732)

### 7. Skip Counting Patterns
Continue or identify patterns:
- **By Tens**: "Count by tens from {{start}}: ___, ___, ___, ___"
- **By Hundreds**: "Count by hundreds from {{start}}: ___, ___, ___, ___"
- **By Fives**: "Count by fives from {{start}} to {{end}}"
- Example: Count by tens from 435: $435, 445, 455, 465, 475$

### 8. Word Problems with Numbers up to 1000
Apply understanding in context:
- **Distance**: "A hiking trail is {{distance}} meters long. Round this to the nearest hundred meters"
- **Money**: "You have {{amount}} cents. How many euros and cents is that?"
- **Comparison**: "Building A is {{height1}} cm tall, Building B is {{height2}} cm. Which is taller?"
- Example: "A rope is 847 cm long. Round to nearest ten: 850 cm"

## Answer Requirements

Provide clear solutions that:
- Show place value reasoning explicitly
- Explain rounding rules (look at the digit to the right)
- Use number line diagrams where helpful
- Include step-by-step comparison methods
