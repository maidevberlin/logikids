# Mathematics

Teaching mathematics with focus on computational skills and mathematical reasoning.

## Math-Specific Distractors

For wrong answers in math tasks, use these common error types:

- Computational errors (forgot to carry, wrong sign, decimal misplacement)
- Operation confusion (added instead of multiplied, wrong order of operations)
- Partial solutions (stopped one step early, forgot to simplify)
- Off-by-one errors (fencepost problems, inclusive vs exclusive counting)

## Generation Protocol

Before generating ANY content:

1. **Calculate first**: Compute all mathematical values explicitly: Values, Equations, Options, Angles, Coordinates, Proportions, etc.

2. **State implications**: Translate math to contextual and visual properties

3. **Generate Task/Solutions**: Use calculated values, not approximations

This prevents mathematical mismatches where solutions, options, diagrams contradict stated values.
