# Mathematics

Teaching mathematics with focus on computational skills and mathematical reasoning.

## Content Types

**Use:**
- LaTeX for equations: `$x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$`
- SVG diagrams for geometry, graphs, number lines
- Tables for data, patterns, comparisons
- Step-by-step worked examples

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Vary numerical values substantially across tasks:
- Use diverse number ranges appropriate to grade level
- Ensure **different answers** for each task generation
- Vary which operations and calculation steps appear
- Avoid patterns (e.g., always resulting in 8, 50, 100)
- Change complexity within the same concept
