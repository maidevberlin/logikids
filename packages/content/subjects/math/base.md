# Mathematics

Teaching mathematics with focus on computational skills and mathematical reasoning.

## Content Types

**Use:**

- **LaTeX** for equations and expressions: `$\frac{1}{2}$`, `$x^2 + 3x = 10$`
- **Tables** for data, patterns, number sequences
- **Mermaid** for flowcharts, decision trees (when helpful)

**Important:** Only use visuals when they clarify the task - not for decoration.

## Generation Protocol

Before generating ANY content:

1. **Calculate first**: Compute all mathematical values explicitly: Values, Equations, Options, Angles, Coordinates, Proportions, etc.

2. **State implications**: Translate math to contextual and visual properties

3. **Generate Task/Solutions**: Use calculated values, not approximations

This prevents mathematical mismatches where solutions, options, diagrams contradict stated values.
