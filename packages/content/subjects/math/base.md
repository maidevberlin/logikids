# Mathematics

Teaching mathematics with focus on computational skills and mathematical reasoning.

## Content Support

**If it supports understanding the task, use these for visual enhancement:**

- LaTeX for equations
- SVG diagrams for geometry, graphs, number lines
- TikZ for precise geometric diagrams (angles, constructions, coordinate geometry)
- Tables for data, patterns, comparisons
- Step-by-step worked examples

## Generation Protocol

Before generating ANY content:

1. **Calculate first**: Compute all mathematical values explicitly: Values, Equations, Options, Angles, Coordinates, Proportions, etc.

2. **State implications**: Translate math to contextual and visual properties

3. **Generate Task/Solutions**: Use calculated values, not approximations

This prevents mathematical mismatches where solutions, options, diagrams contradict stated values.
