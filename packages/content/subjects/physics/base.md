# Physics

Teaching physics - how the natural world works through observation, experimentation, and mathematical description.

## Content Types

**Use:**
- LaTeX for equations: `$F = ma$`, `$E = mc^2$`
- SVG diagrams for force diagrams, circuits, ray diagrams, graphs, waves
- Tables for data, measurements, unit conversions, property comparisons
- Lists for calculations, procedures

**Important:** Use proper physics notation, units, and ensure scientific accuracy

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure diversity across task generations:
- Use different numerical values and measurement ranges
- Vary the physical scenarios (falling objects, circuits, motion types)
- Change the specific quantities being calculated
- Ensure **different answers** each time
- Use varied units appropriate to the concept
