# Matter Tasks

Create physics problems that explore states of matter, material properties, phase changes, and particle behavior through everyday observations and hands-on scenarios. Problems should help students understand how matter behaves in different conditions and why materials have different properties.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **State identification and description**: Present scenarios and ask students to identify which state(s) of matter are involved and describe particle arrangement (solid = tightly packed, liquid = close but mobile, gas = far apart)
- **Phase transition explanation**: Describe what happens during melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, sublimation (e.g., ice melting, water boiling, frost forming); explain particle motion and energy changes
- **Density and buoyancy problems**: Calculate density using $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$, predict whether objects float or sink, explain why ice floats on water or why boats stay afloat
- **Material property comparison**: Compare properties of different materials (hardness, flexibility, conductivity, transparency, magnetic) and explain which material suits specific uses
- **Particle theory applications**: Use particle models to explain observable phenomena like diffusion (smell spreading), thermal expansion (bridges expanding in heat), compression (gases vs. solids)
- **Temperature and state changes**: Identify at what temperatures substances change state (water freezing at 0°C, boiling at 100°C), relate to everyday cooking and weather
- **Mass and volume relationships**: Measure or calculate mass/volume of objects, understand that mass is conserved during state changes while volume can change
- **Material selection scenarios**: Choose appropriate materials for real-world applications based on properties (cookware, clothing, construction, packaging)

**Vary the content/context:**
- **Kitchen and cooking**: Ice in drinks, boiling water for pasta, butter melting, chocolate melting, steam from pots, refrigerator/freezer processes
- **Weather phenomena**: Rain, snow, fog, clouds, frost, dew, hail, evaporation from puddles
- **Everyday objects**: Floating/sinking in bathtub, inflating balloons, pouring liquids, squeezing sponges, stretching rubber bands
- **Nature observations**: Ice on lakes, water vapor from breath on cold days, candle wax melting, dry ice sublimating
- **Material choices**: Why glass for windows, metal for pots, plastic for bottles, wood for furniture, fabric for clothes
- **Science demonstrations**: Dissolving sugar in water, perfume spreading through room, air taking shape of container

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 12): Focus on observation and description, identify three states, simple explanations using particle pictures, qualitative comparisons (heavier/lighter, harder/softer)
- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 12-14): Include simple density calculations $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$, explain phase changes with energy, compare multiple material properties, predict outcomes
- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 15): Quantitative density problems with unit conversions (g/cm³ to kg/m³), explain molecular kinetic theory, analyze pressure-temperature-volume relationships, advanced material science

**Use appropriate formats:**

**LaTeX for formulas:**
- Inline for simple equations: $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$, $\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}}$
- Block for emphasis:

$$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$$

$$\text{where } \rho = \text{density (g/cm³)}, m = \text{mass (g)}, V = \text{volume (cm³)}$$

**Tables for comparing materials:**

| Material | State | Density (g/cm³) | Floats in Water? | Common Use |
|----------|-------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Ice      | Solid | 0.92            | Yes              | Cooling drinks |
| Water    | Liquid| 1.00            | -                | Drinking |
| Wood     | Solid | 0.6-0.8         | Yes              | Furniture |
| Iron     | Solid | 7.87            | No               | Construction |

**Tables for phase change temperatures:**

| Substance | Melting Point (°C) | Boiling Point (°C) | State at Room Temp |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Water     | 0                 | 100                | Liquid             |
| Mercury   | -39               | 357                | Liquid             |
| Iron      | 1538              | 2862               | Solid              |

**Tables for property comparison:**

| Property    | Metal | Plastic | Glass | Wood |
|-------------|-------|---------|-------|------|
| Conducts electricity | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Transparent | ✗ | Sometimes | ✓ | ✗ |
| Flexible    | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

**SVG diagrams for particle models:**

Use SVG to show:
- Particle arrangement in solids, liquids, and gases
- Phase transitions with before/after particle diagrams
- Density comparisons showing particle spacing
- Temperature effects on particle motion

**Adjust difficulty with {{difficulty}}:**
- **Easy**: Identify states from descriptions, qualitative observations, simple yes/no predictions, describe what you see
- **Medium**: Explain reasons using particle theory, simple calculations, compare 2-3 materials, predict outcomes with justification
- **Hard**: Multi-step density calculations, explain complex phenomena, analyze multiple properties, solve real-world material selection problems

- Ensure different materials and answers each time

**Age-appropriate language:**
- **Younger students**: Use simple terms, concrete examples, visual descriptions, relatable scenarios
- **Older students**: Introduce scientific terminology (kinetic energy, molecular motion), abstract concepts, quantitative analysis
