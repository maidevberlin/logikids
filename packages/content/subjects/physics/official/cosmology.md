# Cosmology Tasks

Create physics problems that explore the structure, evolution, and fundamental properties of the universe. Problems should help students understand the Big Bang model and its evidence, apply Hubble's law to galactic recession, recognize the cosmic microwave background as fossil radiation, appreciate the role of dark matter and dark energy (qualitatively), and understand the scale and evolution of cosmic structures while recognizing the limits of current scientific knowledge.

**Vary the problem structure:**
- **Hubble's law calculations** using $v = H_0 \cdot d$: Calculate recession velocity from distance or vice versa, estimate Hubble constant from observations, understand expansion of space (not motion through space)
- **Age of universe estimation**: Use Hubble time $t_H = 1/H_0$ as rough age estimate, understand refinements from cosmological models, calculate age from given Hubble constant
- **Redshift analysis** using $z = \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_0} = \frac{v}{c}$ (non-relativistic approximation): Calculate redshift from recession velocity, determine distance from redshift using Hubble's law, understand redshift as evidence for expansion
- **Cosmic microwave background (CMB)**: Analyze CMB temperature (2.7 K), use Wien's law to find peak wavelength, understand CMB as cooled remnant of hot early universe, recognize as strong Big Bang evidence
- **Scale of universe**: Compare distances to nearby stars (parsecs), galaxies (megaparsecs), observable universe (~14 billion light-years = ~4300 Mpc), understand cosmic distance ladder
- **Expansion interpretation**: Understand that space itself expands (not galaxies moving through static space), "raisin bread" analogy, no center to expansion, all observers see same expansion pattern
- **Dark matter evidence**: Analyze galactic rotation curves (flat rotation curves vs. Kepler's expectation), gravitational lensing observations, understand that ~85% of matter is non-luminous (qualitative)
- **Dark energy and acceleration**: Understand that universal expansion is accelerating (from Type Ia supernova observations), dark energy comprises ~68% of universe energy density, cosmological constant (qualitative)
- **Timeline of universe**: Big Bang → inflation → nucleosynthesis (3 min) → recombination/CMB (380,000 years) → first stars (100 million years) → galaxies → present (13.8 billion years)
- **Cosmological models**: Open, closed, or flat universe depending on density, critical density, understand observational evidence points to flat universe with dark energy

**Vary the content/context:**
- **Historical development**: Hubble's 1929 discovery of galactic recession, initial Big Bang vs. Steady State debate, cosmic microwave background discovery (1964, Penzias & Wilson), modern precision cosmology
- **Observational evidence for Big Bang**: Hubble expansion, CMB existence and uniformity, primordial nucleosynthesis (H, He, Li abundances), large-scale structure formation
- **Hubble's law**: Linear relationship $v = H_0 \cdot d$ for nearby galaxies, Hubble constant $H_0 \approx 70$ km/s/Mpc, indicates expanding universe, distance measurement challenges
- **Cosmic microwave background**: Thermal radiation at 2.7 K, nearly uniform across sky (± 0.0001 K fluctuations), blackbody spectrum, redshifted from ~3000 K at recombination, direct observation of early universe
- **Redshift and distance**: Spectral lines shifted toward red (longer wavelengths), z = 0.1 means 10% wavelength increase, larger z means greater distance/recession velocity, cosmological redshift vs. Doppler shift
- **Large-scale structure**: Galaxies, galaxy clusters, superclusters, filaments and voids, cosmic web, formed from tiny CMB fluctuations via gravitational collapse
- **Dark matter**: Needed to explain galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, structure formation, makes up ~85% of matter, nature unknown (WIMPs, axions?), detected only gravitationally
- **Dark energy**: Explains accelerating expansion, repulsive effect at large scales, ~68% of universe energy density, nature unknown (cosmological constant, quintessence?), Einstein's "biggest blunder" vindicated
- **Observable universe**: Finite region from which light has reached us (~93 billion light-years diameter today due to expansion), cosmic horizon, universe likely much larger or infinite beyond observable portion
- **Open questions**: Nature of dark matter and dark energy, origin of Big Bang, inflation mechanism, ultimate fate of universe (continued expansion vs. Big Crunch/Big Rip), multiverse hypotheses

**Vary the complexity based on age:**
- **For younger ages** ({{age}} < 17): Focus on qualitative understanding of Big Bang model, basic Hubble's law calculations with formula provided, understand CMB as evidence, describe expansion concept with analogies, recognize open questions in cosmology
- **For middle ages** ({{age}} 17-18): Quantitative Hubble's law applications, calculate age of universe from Hubble constant, analyze redshift data, understand relationship between distance-recession velocity-time, describe dark matter and dark energy roles qualitatively, work with cosmic timeline
- **For older ages** ({{age}} >= 18): Connect redshift to wave physics and relativity, derive age estimate from expansion rate, analyze observational evidence critically, understand cosmological principle, discuss density parameters and universe geometry, evaluate limitations of current models, engage with frontier questions

**Use appropriate formats:**

**LaTeX for formulas:**
- Inline for key relationships: $v = H_0 \cdot d$, $z = \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_0}$, $t_H = \frac{1}{H_0}$
- Block for Hubble's law and redshift:

$$v = H_0 \cdot d$$

where $H_0 \approx 70$ km/s/Mpc (Hubble constant), $v$ is recession velocity, $d$ is distance.

Redshift definition:
$$z = \frac{\lambda_{observed} - \lambda_{emitted}}{\lambda_{emitted}} = \frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_0}$$

For non-relativistic velocities:
$$z \approx \frac{v}{c}$$

Age of universe (Hubble time, rough estimate):
$$t_H = \frac{1}{H_0}$$

**Adjust difficulty with {{difficulty}}:**

- **Medium**: Quantitative Hubble's law applications to determine distances or velocities, calculate age of universe from Hubble constant, analyze redshift data, understand CMB temperature and blackbody radiation connection, describe evidence for Big Bang (expansion, CMB, nucleosynthesis), explain role of dark matter in structure formation
- **Hard**: Multi-step problems combining Hubble's law, redshift, and time scales, derive age estimate accounting for acceleration, critically analyze observational evidence and its interpretation, understand cosmological principle and its implications, discuss density parameters and universe fate scenarios, engage with frontier questions and limitations of current models, connect to general relativity concepts

**Include variety in numerical values:**
- Different distances: 10 Mpc, 100 Mpc, 1 Gpc (1000 Mpc), 4 Gpc (edge of observable universe)
- Vary recession velocities: 700 km/s, 7,000 km/s, 70,000 km/s, 200,000 km/s
- Hubble constant: $H_0 = 70$ km/s/Mpc or 72 km/s/Mpc (measurement uncertainty), convert to SI: $2.3 \times 10^{-18}$ s⁻¹
- Redshift values: z = 0.01 (nearby), z = 0.1, z = 1 (halfway across observable universe), z = 1100 (CMB)
- CMB temperature: T = 2.725 K today, T = 3000 K at recombination
- CMB peak wavelength: λ_peak = 1.9 mm (use Wien's law: λ_max·T = 2.898 × 10⁻³ m·K)
- Age calculations: Hubble time $t_H = 1/H_0 \approx 14$ billion years (for $H_0 = 70$ km/s/Mpc)
- Cosmic timeline: 380,000 years (CMB), 100 million years (first stars), 13.8 billion years (today)
- Speed of light: c = 3 × 10⁵ km/s
- Ensure calculations demonstrate expansion and time-distance relationships correctly
