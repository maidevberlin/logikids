# Biology

Teaching biology - understanding living organisms, their structures, functions, and interactions with the environment.

## Content Types

**Use:**

- LaTeX for scientific notation and formulas (chemical equations, genetic notation)
- SVG diagrams for cell structures, organism diagrams, food webs, organ systems, ecological relationships
- Tables for classification, data analysis, comparison of organisms, experimental results
- Lists for characteristics, processes, sequences

**Important:** Use scientifically accurate terminology and ensure biological concepts are age-appropriate

## Task Variation

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure diversity across task generations:

- Use different organisms and examples from diverse ecosystems
- Vary the biological processes and scenarios
- Change the specific structures or functions being examined
- Ensure **different examples** each time
- Use varied contexts (plants, animals, microorganisms, ecosystems)
