name: Logarithms
description: Understanding logarithms as inverse operations of exponentiation, calculating logarithm values, and solving exponential equations
grade: 10
focus: Exponential relationships and inverse operations
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Understand logarithm as the inverse operation of exponentiation
  - Convert between exponential and logarithmic forms
  - Calculate logarithm values for simple cases without calculator
  - Apply logarithm properties to simplify expressions
  - Solve exponential equations using logarithms
  - Use calculators to evaluate logarithms with non-integer results
  - Apply logarithms to solve real-world exponential problems
problem_types:
  - Form conversion
  - Direct evaluation
  - Property application
  - Equation solving
  - Expression simplification
  - Calculator usage
  - Contextual problems
  - Power rule application
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple bases (2, 10, e) with integer results
    - Direct conversion between exponential and logarithmic form
    - Evaluation of log₁₀(100), log₂(8), similar obvious cases
  medium:
    - Apply one or two logarithm properties to simplify
    - Solve exponential equations like 2ˣ = 16 or 10ˣ = 1000
    - Use calculator for non-integer logarithm values
  hard:
    - Chain multiple logarithm properties in complex expressions
    - Solve exponential equations requiring logarithm properties
    - Apply logarithms in multi-step contextual scenarios
prerequisites:
  - grade9-power-functions
real_world_context:
  - Richter scale measures earthquake magnitude using base-10 logarithms (each increase of 1 represents 10 times more energy)
  - pH scale in chemistry uses negative logarithms to measure acidity and alkalinity
  - Decibel scale for sound intensity is logarithmic (doubling sound power increases decibels by about 3)
  - Carbon dating and radioactive decay calculations require logarithms to determine age from half-life
  - Compound interest problems use logarithms to find time needed to reach investment goals
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid logarithms with bases other than 2, 10, or e unless specified
  - Don't use logarithm arguments that are negative or zero
  - Avoid combining too many properties in one expression for medium difficulty
  - Don't assume students know change-of-base formula without introduction
  - Avoid contexts requiring chemistry or physics knowledge beyond basic concepts
