name: Binomial Formulas
description: Master the three binomial formulas for expanding and factoring algebraic expressions efficiently
grade: 9
focus: Algebraic identities and patterns
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Apply the first binomial formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
  - Apply the second binomial formula (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²
  - Apply the third binomial formula (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²
  - Factor expressions using binomial formulas in reverse
  - Use binomial formulas for mental math calculations
  - Recognize binomial patterns in algebraic expressions
problem_types:
  - Expand binomials
  - Factor expressions
  - Mental calculation
  - Pattern recognition
  - Reverse application
  - Mixed operations
  - Word problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Integer coefficients from -10 to 10
    - Single variable expressions only
    - Direct application of one formula
  medium:
    - Coefficients include fractions and decimals
    - Multiple variables (x, y)
    - Requires choosing correct formula
  hard:
    - Complex nested expressions requiring multiple steps
    - Combinations of different formulas
    - Variables with coefficients requiring simplification
prerequisites:
  - grade7-algebraic-terms
real_world_context:
  - Calculate squares of numbers near multiples of 10 mentally (e.g., 29² = (30-1)²)
  - Optimize area calculations in geometry when dimensions are expressed as sums
  - Simplify complex algebraic expressions in physics formulas
  - Recognize factoring patterns in engineering stress-strain relationships
  - Apply to financial calculations involving compound growth differences
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid asking to expand expressions that are already expanded
  - Don't use variables beyond x, y, z (keep notation simple)
  - Avoid expressions where factoring yields trivial (a+0) or (a+a) patterns
  - Don't mix binomial formulas with polynomial division in the same problem
  - Avoid coefficients larger than 20 or fractions with denominators over 12
