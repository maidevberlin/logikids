name: Multiplication Tables
description: Mastering all times tables 1-10 with automatic recall and understanding inverse operations (division facts)
grade: 3
focus: Numbers and operations
difficulty: medium

learning_objectives:
  - Master all times tables from 1×1 to 10×10 with automatic recall
  - Apply inverse operations to solve division facts from multiplication knowledge
  - Use multiplication strategies (skip counting, doubling, patterns, decomposition)
  - Recognize and apply arithmetic patterns in times tables (e.g., 9s pattern, square numbers)
  - Solve missing factor problems using multiplication and division relationships
  - Apply times tables fluently in multi-step word problems
  - Use derived facts to solve unfamiliar multiplication problems (e.g., use 5×6 to find 5×7)

problem_types:
  - Times table recall
  - Inverse division facts
  - Missing factor problems
  - Pattern recognition
  - Derived facts
  - Comparison problems
  - Multi-step calculations
  - Real-world applications
  - Factor pairs
  - Skip counting sequences

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Focus on well-practiced tables (2, 5, 10, 1) and their inverse division facts
    - Products up to 50 and related division problems
    - Single-step problems with clear context
  medium:
    - All times tables 1-10 mixed with inverse division facts
    - Products up to 100 and related division problems
    - Two-step problems combining multiplication and division
  hard:
    - Challenging tables (6, 7, 8, 9) with division and missing factors
    - Multi-step problems requiring strategic thinking
    - Derived facts and pattern-based reasoning

prerequisites:
  - grade2-introduction-to-multiplication

real_world_context:
  - Calculating total items in equal groups (rows of chairs, boxes of eggs, packages of items)
  - Sharing quantities equally and determining group size (dividing treats among friends)
  - Determining cost of multiple identical items or unit price
  - Understanding time relationships (weeks to days, hours to minutes using 7× and 60×)
  - Area calculations using arrays and rectangular arrangements

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid multiplication facts beyond 10×10 (outside grade 3 scope)
  - Don't use factors larger than 10 or products above 100
  - Avoid division problems with remainders in basic recall tasks
  - Don't introduce multi-digit multiplication algorithms (covered in grade 4)
  - Avoid mixing multiplication tables with fractions or decimals

version: 1
version_notes: Initial version following KMK Bildungsstandards for German Grade 3, emphasizing automatic recall of all times tables and inverse division facts
