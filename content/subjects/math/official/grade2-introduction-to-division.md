id: grade2-introduction-to-division
name: Introduction to Division
description: Understanding division through sharing and grouping strategies, connecting to multiplication, and building foundational division facts
grade: 2
focus: Numbers and operations
difficulty: medium

learning_objectives:
  - Understand division as sharing equally among groups
  - Understand division as grouping (making equal groups)
  - Connect division to multiplication as inverse operations
  - Solve simple division facts within 2, 5, and 10 times tables
  - Use visual models (arrays, groups) to solve division problems
  - Recognize division situations in real-world contexts

problem_types:
  - Sharing equally
  - Making equal groups
  - Division from arrays
  - Missing factor (multiplication link)
  - Division facts (2, 5, 10 tables)
  - Real-world sharing problems
  - Real-world grouping problems
  - Inverse operation matching

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Division within 20 (dividends up to 20)
    - Only 2 and 10 times tables (familiar from multiplication)
    - Clear visual support (objects shown in groups)
  medium:
    - Division within 50 (dividends up to 50)
    - All three times tables (2, 5, 10) mixed
    - Combine sharing and grouping interpretations
  hard:
    - Division within 100 (dividends up to 100)
    - Multi-step reasoning (e.g., compare division results)
    - Use inverse relationship to solve unfamiliar facts

prerequisites:
  - grade2-introduction-to-multiplication

real_world_context:
  - Sharing treats fairly among friends (12 cookies shared by 3 children)
  - Packing items into containers (20 pencils into boxes of 5)
  - Organizing objects into equal rows (arranging chairs, planting seeds)
  - Splitting collections into groups (sorting cards into piles)
  - Dividing classroom supplies (distributing crayons, paper, books)

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid division facts beyond the 10 times table
  - Don't use dividends larger than 100 or divisors larger than 10
  - Avoid division with remainders (not covered in grade 2 introduction)
  - Don't combine division with other operations in single problems
  - Avoid abstract contexts unfamiliar to 7-8 year olds

version: 1
version_notes: Initial version following curriculum-aligned scope for German Grade 2, emphasizing equal weight to sharing, grouping, and multiplication relationship
