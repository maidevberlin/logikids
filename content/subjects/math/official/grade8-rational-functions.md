id: grade8-rational-functions
name: Elementary Rational Functions
description: Understanding and working with rational functions of the form f(x) = a/(x+b) + c, including domain restrictions, asymptotes, graphing, and indirect proportionality as a special case
grade: 8
focus: Rational functions and their properties
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Determine the domain of rational functions and identify excluded values
  - Find intersection points of rational functions with coordinate axes
  - Identify and sketch vertical and horizontal asymptotes from function terms
  - Describe how parameter changes (a, b, c) affect the graph shape and position
  - Determine parameters a, b, c from given graphs of rational functions
  - Recognize indirect proportionality as the special case f(x) = a/x
  - Apply rational function models to scientific and real-world contexts
problem_types:
  - Domain determination
  - Axis intersection points
  - Asymptote identification
  - Graph sketching
  - Parameter from graph
  - Function transformation
  - Indirect proportionality
  - Scientific application
  - Graph interpretation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple form f(x) = a/x with integer parameter a
    - Finding domain and asymptotes for basic rational functions
    - Calculating function values at given x-coordinates
  medium:
    - Functions with horizontal shift f(x) = a/(x+b) requiring careful domain analysis
    - Determining parameters from graphs with visible asymptotes and one point
    - Graphing functions with both vertical and horizontal shifts
  hard:
    - General form f(x) = a/(x+b) + c with all three transformations
    - Analyzing how simultaneous parameter changes affect graph behavior
    - Complex word problems requiring rational function modeling
prerequisites:
  - grade7-proportionality
  - grade6-coordinate-system
  - grade6-fractions-basics
real_world_context:
  - Boyle's Law in physics describes gas pressure and volume as indirectly proportional quantities
  - The time needed to complete a task decreases proportionally as more workers are added
  - Concentration of a solution when mixing water with a fixed amount of substance
  - The intensity of light or sound decreases with the square of distance from the source
  - Dilution problems in chemistry where concentration changes with added solvent
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid rational functions with polynomial numerators beyond constants
  - Don't use denominators with degree higher than 1 (quadratic or higher)
  - Avoid parameters causing asymptotes outside coordinate range -10 to 10
  - Don't introduce oblique asymptotes or multiple vertical asymptotes
  - Avoid combining rational functions with trigonometric or exponential functions
