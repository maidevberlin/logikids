id: grade7-symmetry-constructions
name: Symmetry and Geometric Constructions
description: Constructing symmetric figures, perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, and geometric loci
grade: 7
focus: Advanced geometric constructions and symmetry properties
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Construct perpendicular bisectors of line segments using compass and straightedge
  - Construct angle bisectors using compass and straightedge
  - Construct axially symmetric figures with given symmetry axes
  - Construct point symmetric figures with given symmetry centers
  - Identify and construct geometric loci such as circles and bisectors
  - Apply symmetry properties to classify and analyze quadrilaterals
  - Use constructions to solve geometric problems involving distances and angles
problem_types:
  - Perpendicular bisector construction
  - Angle bisector construction
  - Axial symmetry construction
  - Point symmetry construction
  - Locus identification
  - Locus construction
  - Symmetry classification
  - Distance optimization
  - Combined construction tasks
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single construction step with clearly marked starting elements
    - Identifying symmetric figures or completing simple symmetric drawings
    - Recognizing basic loci like circles around a point
  medium:
    - Multi-step constructions combining bisectors and symmetries
    - Constructing perpendicular bisectors or angle bisectors in triangles
    - Determining loci as intersections of construction elements
  hard:
    - Complex construction sequences requiring multiple symmetry operations
    - Proving geometric properties using bisector and locus theorems
    - Optimizing paths or positions using locus constructions
prerequisites:
  - grade6-geometric-constructions
real_world_context:
  - Civil engineers construct perpendicular bisectors to find optimal locations for facilities equidistant from multiple towns or roads
  - Surveyors use angle bisectors to divide land plots fairly or determine sight lines between landmarks
  - Graphic designers apply axial and point symmetry when creating logos, patterns, and visual identities for brands
  - Architects use geometric loci to define curved walls, arches, and spatial boundaries in building designs
  - Urban planners use locus concepts to determine zones of equal access to public services like schools or hospitals
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid constructions requiring protractors or rulers with measurements
  - Don't ask for constructions with more than 4 sequential steps
  - Avoid locus problems where multiple valid interpretations exist
  - Don't combine bisector constructions with angle calculations in degrees
  - Avoid figures where symmetry axes or centers are unclear or ambiguous
