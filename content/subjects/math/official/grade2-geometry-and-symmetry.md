id: grade2-geometry-and-symmetry
name: Geometry and Symmetry
description: Deepening understanding of 2D and 3D shapes, identifying and creating symmetric figures, and working with lines of symmetry
grade: 2
focus: Geometry and spatial reasoning
difficulty: medium

learning_objectives:
  - Describe and compare 2D shapes using properties like sides, corners, and angles
  - Identify and classify 3D shapes by their faces, edges, and vertices
  - Recognize symmetric figures and identify lines of symmetry
  - Create symmetric figures using folding, drawing, or manipulatives
  - Relate 2D faces to 3D shapes (e.g., circles on cylinders, squares on cubes)
  - Apply symmetry concepts to patterns and real-world objects

problem_types:
  - Shape property analysis
  - Symmetry identification
  - Line of symmetry drawing
  - Symmetric completion
  - 2D-3D relationship
  - Face counting
  - Symmetry in patterns
  - Real-world symmetry

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Focus on basic shapes with clear symmetry (square, circle, rectangle)
    - Single line of symmetry, vertical or horizontal only
    - Simple 3D shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder)
  medium:
    - Mix shapes with 0, 1, or 2 lines of symmetry
    - Include diagonal lines of symmetry
    - Compare properties of multiple shapes simultaneously
  hard:
    - Shapes with multiple lines of symmetry (square has 4)
    - Complex symmetric patterns or composite figures
    - Analyze 3D shapes with non-standard orientations

prerequisites:
  - grade1-plane-shapes
  - grade1-solid-shapes

real_world_context:
  - Butterflies, leaves, and flowers often have symmetric patterns
  - Buildings, windows, and doors frequently show symmetry in their design
  - Folding paper to create snowflakes or decorations uses symmetry
  - Many logos, signs, and letters have lines of symmetry (A, H, M, T)
  - Packaging boxes (cereal, juice, gift boxes) are 3D shapes with flat faces

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid technical terms like "rotational symmetry" or "congruent"
  - Don't use shapes with more than 5 sides for symmetry tasks
  - Avoid 3D shapes more complex than cube, cuboid, sphere, cylinder, cone
  - Don't ask students to count all symmetry lines on complex shapes
  - Avoid symmetry tasks requiring precise measurement or angles
