name: Data and Diagrams
description: Determining absolute and relative frequencies, displaying data using circle and column diagrams, calculating and interpreting arithmetic mean, recognizing manipulative presentations in data visualization
grade: 6
focus: Statistical data analysis and critical diagram interpretation
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Determine absolute and relative frequencies from data sets
  - Create circle diagrams and column diagrams using appropriate tools
  - Discuss advantages and disadvantages of different diagram representations
  - Recognize and critique manipulative or misleading diagram presentations
  - Calculate arithmetic mean (average) and interpret its meaning in context
  - Convert between absolute and relative frequencies using percentages
  - Select appropriate diagram types based on data characteristics
problem_types:
  - Frequency calculation
  - Circle diagram creation
  - Column diagram interpretation
  - Diagram type selection
  - Manipulative presentation identification
  - Arithmetic mean calculation
  - Absolute to relative conversion
  - Relative to absolute conversion
  - Multi-representation comparison
  - Critical diagram analysis
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Calculate absolute frequencies from small data sets (5-8 values)
    - Read values directly from clearly labeled diagrams
    - Calculate arithmetic mean from 3-5 whole numbers that result in whole averages
  medium:
    - Convert between absolute and relative frequencies using percentages
    - Choose appropriate diagram type for given data and justify choice
    - Calculate arithmetic mean from 5-10 numbers requiring rounding to one decimal
  hard:
    - Identify misleading presentations (truncated axes, inappropriate scales, selective data)
    - Compare same data across multiple diagram types and discuss implications
    - Work with larger data sets requiring technology for calculation and visualization
prerequisites:
  - grade5-data-collection-charts
  - grade6-fractions-basics
real_world_context:
  - Analyzing survey results from class or school polls with percentages
  - Evaluating media presentations of statistics in news articles or advertisements
  - Comparing product reviews using star ratings and averages
  - Understanding election results shown in circle and column diagrams
  - Tracking personal data like homework time or screen time and calculating weekly averages
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid data sets with more than 12 categories in diagrams
  - Don't use complex statistical measures beyond mean (no median, mode, or range)
  - Avoid requiring exact circle diagram angle calculations
  - Don't create problems requiring decimal percentages beyond one decimal place
  - Avoid contexts with sensitive topics (politics, religion, personal finances)
