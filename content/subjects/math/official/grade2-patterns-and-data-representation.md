name: Patterns and Data Representation
description: Number sequences; data collection; tally charts; simple bar graphs; interpreting data
grade: 2
focus: Pattern recognition and data analysis
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and extend number sequences using addition or subtraction patterns
  - Recognize growing and shrinking patterns in numbers and shapes
  - Create and describe patterns using multiple attributes simultaneously
  - Collect data systematically using surveys or observations
  - Organize data using tally charts with frequency counts
  - Represent data in simple bar graphs with labeled axes
  - Interpret data from charts and graphs to answer questions
problem_types:
  - Number sequence
  - Growing pattern
  - Shrinking pattern
  - Multi-attribute pattern
  - Tally chart creation
  - Bar graph reading
  - Data comparison
  - Frequency counting
  - Survey results
  - Data interpretation
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Number sequences with single-digit increments (2, 4, 6, 8)
    - Tally charts with 3-4 categories
    - Bar graphs with simple whole-number scales (1, 2, 3)
  medium:
    - Number sequences with patterns like +5, -3, or doubling
    - Tally charts with 5-6 categories
    - Bar graphs requiring interpretation of 2-3 data sets
  hard:
    - Number sequences with two-step patterns or skip counting by larger numbers
    - Complex tally charts requiring sorting into categories first
    - Bar graphs requiring comparison, finding differences, or totals
prerequisites:
  - grade1-patterns-and-data
real_world_context:
  - Number patterns help predict what comes next in sequences like house numbers or calendar dates
  - Tally charts are used to count votes in class elections or track daily weather observations
  - Bar graphs show survey results like favorite school subjects or number of books read each month
  - Data collection helps answer questions like "How many students prefer each lunch option?"
  - Growing patterns appear in plant growth, stacking blocks, or saving money over weeks
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid number sequences beyond 100
  - Don't use fractions or decimals in number patterns
  - Avoid bar graphs with scales requiring multiplication beyond 2x or 5x tables
  - Don't combine multiple mathematical operations within a single pattern
  - Avoid data scenarios requiring knowledge of topics unfamiliar to 7-8 year olds
