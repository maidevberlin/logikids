name: Measurement and Unit Conversion
description: Converting between units of length, mass, volume, and time; understanding decimal notation for measurements; estimating and solving word problems with measurements
grade: 4
focus: Measurement systems and unit conversion
difficulty: medium
learning_objectives:
  - Convert between metric length units (km, m, cm, mm) and express in decimal notation
  - Convert between metric mass units (t, kg, g) with multi-step conversions
  - Convert between metric volume units (L, mL) including combined units
  - Calculate time durations across hours, minutes, and seconds
  - Estimate measurements using appropriate units and real-world reference points
  - Solve word problems involving measurement conversions and calculations
  - Choose appropriate units for measuring different quantities
problem_types:
  - Length conversion
  - Mass conversion
  - Volume conversion
  - Time duration calculation
  - Decimal notation conversion
  - Mixed unit simplification
  - Measurement estimation
  - Multi-step word problems
  - Unit selection
  - Conversion chain problems
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single-step conversions with round numbers (2 km = 2000 m, 3000 g = 3 kg)
    - Simple decimal notation (1.5 km = 1500 m, 2.3 L = 2300 mL)
    - Direct time calculations (90 minutes = 1 hour 30 minutes)
  medium:
    - Two-step conversions (1.5 km to cm, 2500 g to kg with decimal)
    - Mixed unit operations (2 kg 350 g + 1 kg 800 g)
    - Time durations spanning multiple hours with start/end times
  hard:
    - Multi-step conversions across three or more units (2.5 km to mm)
    - Complex word problems requiring unit selection and conversion
    - Comparing measurements in different units (e.g., 1.2 m vs 115 cm)
prerequisites:
  - grade3-measurement-mass-volume
  - grade3-time-and-duration
real_world_context:
  - Converting distances for hiking, biking, or running routes between kilometers and meters
  - Calculating cooking recipe measurements when scaling ingredients up or down
  - Reading product packaging that shows measurements in different units (500 mL bottle vs 0.5 L)
  - Planning travel times and calculating journey durations with departure and arrival times
  - Comparing prices per unit weight at the grocery store (price per kg vs per 100 g)
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid imperial units (miles, pounds, gallons, inches)
  - Don't use units beyond metric system (t, kg, g, km, m, cm, mm, L, mL)
  - Avoid mixing different measurement types in conversions (kg to liters)
  - Don't require knowledge of area units (m², cm²) or volume units (m³)
  - Avoid time zones, 24-hour notation, or calendar date calculations
