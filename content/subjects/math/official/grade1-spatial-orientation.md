name: Spatial Orientation
description: Understanding and using position words to describe locations and follow directions
grade: 1
focus: Spatial relationships and positional vocabulary
difficulty: easy
learning_objectives:
  - Use position words (left, right, above, below, in front, behind, next to, between) to describe object locations
  - Follow multi-step directions involving spatial relationships
  - Identify relative positions of objects in relation to oneself or other objects
  - Describe paths and routes using directional language
  - Compare positions of multiple objects using spatial vocabulary
problem_types:
  - Position identification
  - Direction following
  - Location description
  - Relative positioning
  - Path description
  - Spatial comparison
  - Object arrangement
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Single position word (left OR right, above OR below)
    - 1-2 objects in simple arrangements
    - Clear, unambiguous spatial relationships
  medium:
    - Combined position words (left AND above, between two objects)
    - 3-4 objects with multiple spatial relationships
    - Simple multi-step directions (2 steps)
  hard:
    - Complex position descriptions using multiple reference points
    - 5+ objects requiring careful spatial reasoning
    - Multi-step directions (3+ steps) with combined position words
real_world_context:
  - Finding items in the classroom (book on the shelf above the desk, pencil in the drawer below)
  - Following directions to locate places in school or at home
  - Describing where people are sitting or standing in relation to each other
  - Giving directions for games, treasure hunts, or finding hidden objects
  - Organizing items in specific positions (toys on the shelf, clothes in the closet)
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid using diagonal directions (northeast, southwest) not in Grade 1 curriculum
  - Don't combine more than 3 position words in a single description
  - Avoid mirror/reflection concepts beyond simple left-right awareness
  - Don't use coordinate systems or grid references
  - Avoid abstract spatial concepts requiring mental rotation beyond 180 degrees
