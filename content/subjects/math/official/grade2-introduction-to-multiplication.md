name: Introduction to Multiplication
description: Understanding multiplication as repeated addition, arrays, equal groups, and foundational times tables (2, 5, 10)
grade: 2
focus: Numbers and operations
difficulty: medium

learning_objectives:
  - Understand multiplication as repeated addition and counting equal groups
  - Use array models (rows and columns) to visualize multiplication
  - Master times tables for 2, 5, and 10 with automatic recall
  - Apply multiplication in real-world contexts (equal groups, arrays, skip counting)
  - Recognize the commutative property (3×4 = 4×3)
  - Connect multiplication to division as inverse operations

problem_types:
  - Repeated addition
  - Array visualization
  - Equal groups
  - Skip counting
  - Times table facts
  - Missing factor
  - Real-world problems
  - Commutative property

difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Use factors 1-5 with products up to 20
    - Times tables 2 and 10 only (most familiar)
    - Clear visual support (arrays, groups shown)
  medium:
    - Use factors 1-10 with products up to 50
    - All three times tables (2, 5, 10) mixed
    - Combine concepts (e.g., array with missing factor)
  hard:
    - Use factors up to 10 with products up to 100
    - Multi-step problems (e.g., compare two multiplications)
    - Apply commutative property to solve unfamiliar facts

prerequisites:
  - grade1-addition-subtraction-to-20

real_world_context:
  - Counting legs on animals (each dog has 4 legs, how many on 5 dogs?)
  - Arranging items in rows (egg cartons, muffin tins, garden beds)
  - Skip counting in everyday situations (counting by 2s for shoes, by 5s for fingers)
  - Buying multiple identical items (cost of 3 cookies at 5 cents each)
  - Sharing equally (if 10 candies go into 2 bags, how many per bag?)

anti_patterns:
  - Avoid multiplication facts beyond 10×10 (too advanced for grade 2)
  - Don't use factors larger than 10 or products above 100
  - Avoid combining multiplication with addition/subtraction in single problems
  - Don't introduce times tables other than 2, 5, and 10
  - Avoid abstract contexts unfamiliar to 7-8 year olds
