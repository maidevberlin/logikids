difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Use concrete, everyday nouns (Hund, Tisch, Kind)
    - Simple sentences with 3-5 words
    - Clear visual or contextual clues for noun identification
  medium:
    - Mix of concrete and slightly abstract nouns (Freude, Spiel)
    - Sentences with 5-7 words containing multiple nouns
    - Nouns in different sentence positions
  hard:
    - Include proper nouns alongside common nouns
    - Longer sentences (7-10 words) with multiple nouns
    - Less familiar but age-appropriate nouns
real_world_context:
  - Writing stories and labeling pictures in German class requires capitalizing all nouns correctly

  - Learning proper nouns helps children write their own names, friends' names, and places correctly
  - Understanding nouns helps organize vocabulary lists and word sorting activities
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid introducing articles (der/die/das) - focus only on capitalization
  - Don't use plural forms - keep nouns singular for Grade 2
  - Avoid compound nouns (Hausaufgabe) - use simple single-word nouns
  - Don't include abstract nouns beyond simple emotions (Mut, Glück)
  - Avoid sentences longer than 10 words
