id: grade5-sentence-elements
name: Sentence Elements and Clause Structure
description: Advanced sentence analysis including identifying all sentence elements (Satzglieder), distinguishing main and subordinate clauses, and understanding different types of adverbial modifiers
grade: 5
focus: Syntactic analysis and clause relationships
difficulty: hard
learning_objectives:
  - Identify and distinguish all sentence elements including subject, predicate, and various object types in complex sentences
  - Analyze and categorize adverbial modifiers by their semantic function (local, temporal, modal, causal)
  - Distinguish between main clauses and subordinate clauses based on verb position and syntactic independence
  - Recognize the structural difference between compound sentences (Satzreihe) and complex sentences (Satzgefüge)
  - Apply correct conjunction types (coordinating vs subordinating) to connect clauses appropriately
  - Identify different sentence types (statement, question, exclamation, command) and their characteristic features
  - Determine the function of sentence elements using systematic questioning techniques (Wer/Was? Wen/Was? Wem? etc.)
problem_types:
  - Sentence element identification
  - Subject-predicate recognition
  - Object type classification
  - Adverbial modifier categorization
  - Main clause isolation
  - Subordinate clause detection
  - Clause type determination
  - Conjunction categorization
  - Question-based element analysis
  - Sentence structure comparison
difficulty_guidelines:
  easy:
    - Simple sentences with clear subject, predicate, and one or two complements
    - Main clauses with coordinating conjunctions (und, oder, aber, denn)
    - Basic adverbials with clear single function (only temporal or only local)
  medium:
    - Complex sentences with subordinate clauses using common conjunctions (weil, dass, wenn)
    - Sentences with multiple objects (both dative and accusative)
    - Adverbials requiring semantic interpretation to classify correctly
  hard:
    - Nested clause structures with multiple subordination levels
    - Sentences with all element types present simultaneously
    - Ambiguous cases requiring deep syntactic analysis to resolve element boundaries
prerequisites:
  - grade4-sentence-structure
real_world_context:
  - Students analyze sentence structure when editing their own writing to ensure clarity and avoid run-on sentences
  - Understanding clause types helps students punctuate complex sentences correctly, especially comma placement before subordinate clauses
  - Recognizing sentence elements supports students in translating between German and other languages with different word order patterns
  - Identifying adverbial types helps students answer comprehension questions about when, where, how, and why events occur in texts
  - Analyzing subordinate clauses improves students' ability to express causal relationships, conditions, and temporal sequences in argumentative writing
anti_patterns:
  - Avoid sentence structures requiring knowledge of relative clauses or attributes
  - Do not include subjunctive mood or indirect speech constructions
  - Avoid prepositional objects (präpositionales Objekt) beyond Grade 5 scope
  - Do not use more than two levels of clause embedding
  - Avoid archaic or literary word order patterns unfamiliar to students
