================================================================================
RECOMMENDED EXECUTION STRATEGIES
================================================================================

STRATEGY 1: SINGLE WRITER (8 weeks total)
  - Process Phases 1-4 sequentially
  - 2 batches per week
  - Commitment: 10-11 hours/week
  - Advantage: One person maintains consistency
  - Disadvantage: Longest timeline

STRATEGY 2: TWO WRITERS (4 weeks total)
  - Each writer processes 2 subjects (e.g., Writer A: Math+English, Writer B: German)
  - Run batches in parallel within each phase
  - Commitment: 20 hours/week per writer (or 10/week for half-time)
  - Advantage: 50% time savings, good resource utilization
  - Disadvantage: Coordination overhead

STRATEGY 3: THREE WRITERS (2-3 weeks total) *** RECOMMENDED ***
  - Writer 1: German (105 concepts, most time-consuming)
  - Writer 2: Math (54 concepts, medium complexity)
  - Writer 3: English (44 concepts, least complex)
  - All writers work through phases in parallel
  - Commitment: ~25-30 hours per writer
  - Advantage: Fastest timeline, subject specialization
  - Disadvantage: Need qualified writers in each area

STRATEGY 4: PHASED SINGLE WRITER + SUBAGENT (4-5 weeks)
  - One writer creates detailed specs for each batch
  - Subagent implementation team handles coding/enhancement
  - Good for knowledge transfer
  - Requires strong specification documentation

  Total: 78 concepts, ~30-35 hours

TIER 3 - VALUABLE (Complete Third):
  - Math Grades 5-6: 17 concepts (advanced geometry/stats)
  - German Grades 5-6: 50 concepts (advanced literature/rhetoric)
  Total: 67 concepts, ~25-30 hours

================================================================================
NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
================================================================================

1. Decide on execution strategy (1-3 writers)
2. Allocate team resources
3. Create shared workspace/documentation
4. Begin with Batch 1A (Math Grades 1-3) as proof-of-concept
5. Iterate and refine process based on first batch results
6. Document patterns and create reusable templates
7. Implement QA checkpoints every 2-3 batches

Estimated Go-Live for Phase 1: 1-2 weeks from start
Full Completion Timeline: 2-8 weeks depending on team size

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Search Criteria:
- Scanned all 291 concept files across 6 subjects
- Identified concepts missing BOTH:
  1. example_tasks: field in YAML frontmatter
  2. real_world_context: field in YAML frontmatter
- Excluded base.md files (subject guidelines)
- No custom concepts found missing (all custom concepts already enhanced)

Validation:
- Grep search for exact field names in markdown files
- Manual verification of sample concepts
- Cross-checked against git history for recent enhancements
- Confirmed Logic, Music, Physics subjects are 100% complete
