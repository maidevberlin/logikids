## Recommendations for Execution

### Optimal Strategy: Three-Writer Team (2-3 weeks total)
1. **Writer 1:** German (high volume, most time-consuming)
2. **Writer 2:** Math (medium volume, medium complexity)
3. **Writer 3:** English (lowest volume, lower complexity)

Each writer processes their subject through all phases in parallel.

### Single Writer Strategy (8 weeks total)
- Process 2 batches per week sequentially
- Focus on Phase 1 foundations first for immediate impact
- Time commitment: ~10-11 hours per week

### Key Success Factors
1. **Consistent Template:** Use existing enhanced concepts as reference
2. **Quality Checks:** Test 1-2 concepts per batch with actual task generation
3. **Documentation:** Record patterns and techniques for replication
4. **Iterative Feedback:** Adjust approach after first batch of each subject
